Rod Johnson, Spring founder, in the [TSS thread](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=50727) about the new [SpringSource maintenance policy](http://www.springsource.com/products/enterprise/maintenancepolicy/faq):

> Anyone who refuses to compile an open source project under any circumstances doesn't really believe in open source: they believe in other people working for them for free.

Well said.
