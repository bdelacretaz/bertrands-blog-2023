Google's [Summer Of Code](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html) program has been expanded (wow - thanks Google) to support [400 students](http://code.google.com/index.html), double what was initially planned. Of course, with 8'700 applications, there are some choices to make...

At the [ASF](http://apache.org) we're the happy recipients of more than 600 applications, with about a week to rate them. For the really good ones and the plain crap ones it's easy, but in the middle there's more work to do...

By the way, if you're a mentor for an ASF project, make sure to read the note at the top of our [ideas page](http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2005) - we need you on the mentors mailing list.
