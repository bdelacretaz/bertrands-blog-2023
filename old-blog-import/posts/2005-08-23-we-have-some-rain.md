After a week in the dry south of France (like the showers switched off most of the day), I'm back to find quite a lot of rain around here.

Our area is ok but around Jeremias's place they have a lot more water. He has posted some [pictures](http://jeremias.maerki.org/album/HochwasserAugust2005/index.html). Amazing to see, but certainly no fun if you live there. Jeremias himself lives a bit higher so no problem for him.

_There are more pictures on the [Berghilfe](http://www.berghilfe.ch/medien/unwetterbilder/) website. It's in German, but if you click on links like "Aegerital" in the middle of the page you'll see the pictures.
