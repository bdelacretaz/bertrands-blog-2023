Just found out that the great [Bertrand Meyer](http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer) teaches (almost) next door, at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Didn't know that, lucky students there!

Furthermore, the draft of his upcoming _introduction to programming_ book, [Touch of class - learning to program _well_](http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/down/touch), is available online.

Make sure you read the _inverted curriculum_ paragraph on the above page - why should students learn by reading their own or other student's crappy code? Show them the best!

From the book draft, I like the emphasis on _well_ in the title a lot, and his definition of objects is cool:

> An object is a software machine allowing programs to access and modify a collection of data.

One more for the _books to read_ virtual shelf...
