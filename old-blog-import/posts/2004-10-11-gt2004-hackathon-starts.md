I didn't bring my camera but others are [posting photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/cocoongt2004) already.

The BigBadBug table is ready with the title of all open bugs printed out to make them easy to grab. We'll get them ;-)

_Update: if you wonder what a hackathon looks like, here's a nice picture courtesy of Daniele Madama. Thanks!_
