I know Sandro back from the [LOTS](http://lots.openexpo.ch/2005/) days, and few people combine such a dedication to Open Source with field-proven marketing skills.

So, if you're in the market for such services, I'd suggest taking a look at Sandro's new [Open Source Marketing Consultancy](http://sandro.groganz.com/weblog/2008/01/02/starting-open-source-marketing-consultancy/) services.
