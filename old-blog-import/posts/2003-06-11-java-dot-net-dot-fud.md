It might be a good idea for Sun to launch what looks like a [better SourceForge](http://java.net/index.html). They integrated a wiki, which makes my coolness meter jump up instantly!

Did I read correctly though? JAVA DOT NET? What does Sun gain from feeding the confusion in so many people's minds, about _choosing between dot net and Java_ (which is the wrong question if you ask me)?

I agree with [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/000981.html) that _the important thing is that large business start to care about OSS activities around their core technology._. [Nicola Ken](http://www.freeroller.net/page/nicolaken/20030610#title_java_net_fud_title) sees FUD, and considering some of Sun's [recent moves](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000057.html) he might be right too.

Time will tell. But _java dot net_? Really?
