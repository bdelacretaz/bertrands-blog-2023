What's your [Google Number](http://www.hr.com/hrcom/general/pf.cfm?oID=5635CFB8-953A-4776-AAD8B1E1404DC46F)?

Let's experiment a bit :

[Grady Booch](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22grady+booch%22) gets 27'000 .

[Jesus Christ](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Jesus Christ%22) gets 3,820,000 .

[the Beatles](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22the Beatles%22) gets 1,300,000. So according to Google they're indeed _less_ popular than Jesus Christ.

[Jerry Pournelle](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Jerry+Pournelle%22) gets 27'300.

[Bertrand Meyer](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22bertrand+meyer%22) gets 25,800 .

[Linus Torvalds](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Linus+Torvalds%22%22) gets 627,000. Wow.

[Pekka Himanen](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Pekka+Himanen%22%22) gets 6,990.

[William Gibson](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22William+Gibson%22) gets 240'000.

[Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Tim+Berners-Lee%22%22) gets 92,700. Well-deserved.

[C-F Ramuz](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22C-F+Ramuz%22+OR+%22Charles-Ferdinand+Ramuz%22) gets 3'560. Not bad for a Swiss french author who's been dead since 1947.

[Yours truly](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22bertrand+delacretaz%22) gets 4,210.

So there's certainly a pattern here, but I wouldn't go too far with this. This is [statistics](http://www.spicyquotes.com/html/Benjamin_Disraeli_Statistics.html) after all.

Via [Gregor](http://greg.abstrakt.ch/archives/001502.html) who says he gets 23,500, but when I run the [query link](http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22gregor+j.+rothfuss%22+OR+%22gregor+rothfuss%22+OR+%22rothfuss%2C+gregor%22+OR+%22greg+rothfuss%22&btnG=Google+Search) on his page Google says 16,900. Statistics...
