If you're running a decent browser you should be able to display this [secret message](text/html;base64,Q29uZ3JhdHVsYXRpb25zLCB5b3UndmUgZm91bmQgdGhlIDxlbT5zZWNyZXQ8L2VtPiBkYXRhOiBtZXNzYWdlIQ==).

See also the much cooler [sparklines](http://bitworking.org/news/Sparklines_in_data_URIs_in_Python) examples, based on [Edward Tufte's](http://www.edwardtufte.com/) ideas.

I have started collecting bookmarks for this under the [dataurl](http://del.icio.us/tag/dataurl) tag at del.icio.us (and [sparklines](http://del.icio.us/tag/sparklines) is often related).
