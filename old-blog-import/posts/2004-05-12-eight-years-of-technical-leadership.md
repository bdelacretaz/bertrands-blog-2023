Here's the [press release](http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=announce@apache.org&msgNo=119): the Apache HTTP server is definitely becoming the _dialtone of the Web_.

Congratulations!

By the way, have you noticed the [httpd docs](http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/)? They're _really_ good, very well organized.

Although it's well known that...let's say _some open source projects_ have inferior docs, this is one of the best counter-examples.
