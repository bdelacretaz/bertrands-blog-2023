Someone gets [fired](http://www.michaelhanscom.com/eclecticism/2003/10/of_blogging_and.html) by a (too) well-known company after leaking information that is certainly no secret. Does anyone doubt that Microsoft is using or testing Macs? I don't.

Sh\*\*t happens, more in some places than in others I guess...
