Although blogging is supposed to be meant to express yourself, sometimes other people are so much better than this self at expressing things that I give up...  

This [letter](http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15406) from Michael Moore to President Bush is a perfect example, so well written that I won't attempt to put my own feelings to virtual paper, about the tragicomedy that's happening these days.

Got it from [Matthew](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103021/) who got it from [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/). It is hard not to agree on this I guess.
