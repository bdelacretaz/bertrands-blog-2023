That is the [question](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112811752100002&r=1&w=2) on our lists today.

Here's what I feel to be the most important excerpt from [my reply](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=112833205120768&w=2):

For me Cocoon today is:

\- An Ã¼bercool integration platform: combine widely varying data sources easily and safely while keeping your code and system structure clean.

\- A great help in structuring and implementing complex apps which include some form of web interaction (but the web part might not be the most important).

\- The best tool that I know today to build long-lived systems, which are meant to be actively developed for years and as such need a very clean, modular and open structure, to be maintained at a reasonable cost and stay manageable.

\- A collection of components written and assembled by some of the brightest programmers around, and it shows, although as with all bazaar developments finding your way is not always easy.

\- A framework to build powerful tools: Forrest, Lenya, Daisy...

All this has little to do with the client-side technology being used, so no, I don't think Cocoon is obsolete, not at all.

In my opinion Cocoon is and will stay a niche tool, but for a fairly big niche, which includes many silent guests...my feeling is that many companies don't want to talk about the kind of strategic systems where Cocoon is involved.

_Update: Stefano has [more to say](http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/94/) on his weblog, in his usual enlightening way. A great read, and I guess the PiggyBank code must be worth looking at!_
