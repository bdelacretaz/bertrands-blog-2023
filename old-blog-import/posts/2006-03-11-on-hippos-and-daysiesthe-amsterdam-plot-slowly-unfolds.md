Interesting thoughts and insights from [Steven](http://blog.outerthought.org/articles/2006/03/10/daisy-press-sighting-the-heat-is-on) about how their ([Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org)\-based) [Daisy CMS](http://cocoondev.org/daisy) is quietly becoming an important part of the CMS (notice I'm not saying _open-source CMS_) landscape.

He picks on [Hippo](http://www.hippocms.org/) for not (yet) being as open as Daisy, and I agree that being open from the start is better - or easier at least. I bet most software vendors, if they could go back, would open up 98% of their stuff.

[Andrew](http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/archives/001071.html) replies from the front lines, confirming that opening up existing software is hard work. But apparently they're getting there!

Coming late to the party is much harder - and this explains why several people from the Cocoon and CMS space suddenly [love Amsterdam in winter](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000620.html) ;-)

About the encouragements: here are mine both hippos and daysies: keep up your great work guys, along with the friendly competition!

Of course _friendly_ has a different tone and shape depending on your cultural background, and I don't feel any of you guys to be particularly soft-spoken ;-) But maybe the open source world is reinventing competition as well?

We live in exciting times...
