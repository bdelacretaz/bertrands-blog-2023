...but much less than the Windows API, which Joel Spolsky believes to be [dead](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html).

I tend to agree: his salary comparison ($130'000 for a COM programmer vs. $80'000 for a web applications programmer) is similar to the situation with COBOL: you can either make a pile of money on boring and outdated stuff, or decent money on fun and modern stuff. This seems to confirm that the Windows API is on its way out.
