[This post](http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/2004/05/25#asl-gpl-silly) from Brian McCallister comes at the right time, as I was discussing this yesterday with someone: can you distribute ASL (Apache Software License) licensed code as part of a GPL product?

Although the Free Software Foundation basically says [no](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#NonFreeSoftwareLicense), a simple [exception](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs) can be added to the GPL license to allow this. Brian has more details in his post.

So it looks like there are workarounds for this...dare I say _legalish crap_? Sorry for people who honestly contribute their time to create better licenses, but all the energy devoted to these ASL/GPL/LGPL licensing talks in the last few months could be used for more fun and useful work.
