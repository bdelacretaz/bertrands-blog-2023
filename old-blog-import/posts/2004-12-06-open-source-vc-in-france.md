Congratulations [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/archives/000150.html) - his [company](http://www.anyware-tech.com/) (which is betting the farm on Cocoon) just got 3 million euro funding from French VCs.

It feels really good to hear about this from a neighbouring country which speaks the same language as (this part of) mine.

I'm sure Switzerland will wake up to open source at some point, it's just that we tend to be a little slow here ;-)
