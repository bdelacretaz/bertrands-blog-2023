![thanks-arje.jpg](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/thanks-arje.jpg)Everything's running smoothly here at the [Cocoon GT 2005](http://www.cocoongt.org), thanks to this man (shown here _before_ he got his coffee) and his team!

We're having a great time as usual, had two productive Hackathon days and today looks good already - have a look at the [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/groups/cocoongt2005/pool/). Audio recordings should be available after the conference.

Big thanks to Arj√© and the [Hippo](http://www.hippo.nl) team!
