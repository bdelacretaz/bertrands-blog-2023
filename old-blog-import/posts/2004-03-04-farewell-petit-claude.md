French _words and groove master_ [Claude Nougaro](http://www.nougaro.com/) died today. [swissinfo](http://www.swissinfo.org) has some video excerpts about him, in French (search for "Nougaro"). Just hearing him speak makes me want to tap my feet ;-)

Calling a 74-year old singer "groove master" might seem funny: many people would consider him "just" a jazzman, but if you listen to _Nougayork_ and some of the following albums it's much more than jazz. Nougaro was as much into funk and world music (or just Music maybe) as anything else.

I will miss him.
