[![superstars.jpg](images/superstars.jpg)](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/07/gmail-superstars.html)From the _very useful_ department: the [Gmail superstars](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/07/gmail-superstars.html) option augments the message starring feature with different colors and shapes.

Very useful if like me you keep your (small of course) to-do list in your inbox.
