title: "SafariU - custom textbooks and learning objects sharing"

O'Reilly announces [SafariU](http://safariu.oreilly.com/), where teachers can build customized textbooks by taking parts of contents from many existing books (and adding _your name on the cover_ as they stress it in the video).

Looks like the book industry is moving - it has to. They've also added a learning objects sharing system where teachers will be able to exchange lesson plans, quizzes, sample code, etc.

There's a small catch: after 60 days, membership is only open to teachers whose students purchase at least $700 worth of products a year. Understandable considering the amount of work needed to keep this running, but it will prevent many teachers from participating in the learning objects exchange.

To me, it looks like there would be space for a commons-based version of that one. Sounds like another cool project to think about...
