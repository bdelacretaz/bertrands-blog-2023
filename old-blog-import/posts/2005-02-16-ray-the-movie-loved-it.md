Thanks to an invitation from Cyril we went to see [Ray the Movie](http://www.raymovie.com) as an avant-premiere yesterday evening.

Beautiful! The only small Hollywoodish negative point for us was the dream scene with Ray and his brother and mom meet again, but apart from that this movie has _guts_.

Me, I like movies which tell (hopefully mostly) true stories, and this is a great story well told.
