If you want to speak at [ApacheCon Europe 2005](http://apachecon.com/2005/EU/), in July, today's the deadline for proposals. There are several variants of the exact deadline time on the site, but it mostly looks like it's today...

I've sent my proposals, including a talk entitled _on being independent_ where I'd like to share my experience after more than 15 years of doing this. Looks like I missed the 15th year celebration in 2004, by the way.

I don't know if this fits the general tone of the conference, we'll see what they think! My other proposals are more technical, you can count on me for large-scale advertisements here if they are accepted ;-)

_Didier: I told you I was not dead, see I'm blogging again ;-)_

_Update: the deadline has been [extended](http://apachecon.com/2005/EU/) to 22h30 EST Saturday, 12 March 2005_
