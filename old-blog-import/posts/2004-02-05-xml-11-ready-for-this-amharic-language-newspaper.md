W3C has issued the [XML 1.1 recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/), received with...mixed feelings by the XML community.

[Elliotte Rusty Harold](http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/books/effectivexml/chapters/03.html) thinks everybody should stay with XML 1.0, unless you're _developing a system exclusively for a local Amharic-language newspaper in Addis Abeba where everybody including the IT staff speaks Amharic_ (his words).

My goddaughter does, or rather did speak Amharic, as she's not using it much today. Anyway I don't think we'll be doing such a project soon. So I guess I'll follow the above advice ;-)
