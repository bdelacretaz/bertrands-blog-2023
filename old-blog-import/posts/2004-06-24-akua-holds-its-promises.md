![](images/akua.jpg)We went to see the [akua](http://www.akua.ch) show yesterday evening and we had a ball - as [expected](http://www.codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000272.html).

These guys are just plain crazy: the show includes completely sinking a big part of the stage, burning in flames while actors are seemingly fighting for their life. Not to mention that a big construction crane is one of the main props, used to carry actors and monsters around the aquatic stage.

Dialogue is mostly french with a funny mix of italian and english (and swiss-german cursing), but I'm sure one would enjoy the show even without understanding everything, it is very visual.

All this accompanied by great live music, played by a trio of amphibious musicians going from rough punkish sounds to gentle acoustic guitar and violin stuff to serve the show.

I don't know if these guys have an official motto but I can imagine something like _why do something normal when you can blow the socks off people_...food for tought!

_I have lifted the picture from their website, seems like fair use given the millions thousands maybe one or two people who will attend the show after reading this._
