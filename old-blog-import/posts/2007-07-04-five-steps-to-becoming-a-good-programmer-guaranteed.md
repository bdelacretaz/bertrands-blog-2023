You'll find heaps of those [three steps to becoming a good programmer](http://www.dzone.com/r/3_steps_to_become_a_good_programmer.html) recipes on the web, but believe me: they're all wrong!

Becoming a good programmer actually takes _five_ steps, presented here as a world premiere exclusively for my (two) readers:

1. Start by being a great programmer.
2. Drink too much beer.
3. Sleep too little.
4. Watch lots of TV.
5. Leave Windows open for too long.

Results are guaranteed.
