Carlos Perez puts OSGI and JCR number 5 and 4 in his list of [top Java-based technologies](http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/five-java-technologies-to-learn-in-2008) to learn in 2008.

While I'm not a big fan of "top five" lists (except in [High Fidelity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/)), I can't help but note that [Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling/) will help you grasp both #5 and #4, in a gentle way. See you there!
