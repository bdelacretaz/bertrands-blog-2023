Cocoon's recurrent hero [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/) has added [Cocoon Stack Traces](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=112290184904128&w=2) to Cocoon error reports and logs.

The screenshot is from the `samples/errorhandling/exception/generror` page.

Having a Cocoon-level trace of the problem will be a big help in debugging and understanding things. Adding ExceptionActions here and there when studying how something works is the newest trick I guess ;-)

Thanks Sylvain, this is an important step towards making Cocoon more usable!

Thinking about it, and seeing other things that are in our collective _pipeline_, 2005 might well be the Year Cocoon Became Usable For Mere Mortals...
