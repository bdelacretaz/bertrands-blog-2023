[Numerous](http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,62897,00.html) [reports](http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3334221), along with the Google's publishing of an easy to spot [April's fools](http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html) announcement, seem to indicate that [GMail](http://gmail.google.com) is real. And they even have a sign in box now!

[Matthew](http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001722.html), who was also wondering, I'm glad ;-) reports on a [screenshot](http://www.thauvin.net/blog/news.jsp?date=2004-04-01#770) (which itself might be an April's fool, isnt'it?) showing...nothing special.

What would make the difference for many people is having their whole email history _at their fingertips_: until everyone's computer is fully indexed (and I'm wondering why it's not yet the case), being able to quickly search all your messages will make all the difference.

Google seems to really be listening to what people want, as opposed to forcing [stuff](http://office.microsoft.com/) down people's throats. This should make them more and more popular, so let's hope they continue to _not be evil_ in order not to become the next _unfriendly giant_.
