Had a great time yesterday evening, eating with Ceki, Erik, Alexandre and Serge at a cool (but somewhat noisy) Mexican restaurant here in Lausanne.

We all live within an hour's drive of each other these days, so it was easy to get together.

Getting people from [log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/), [Orbeon](http://orbeon.com), [Wine](http://winehq.org), [Jahia](http://jahia.com) and [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org) to spend a whole evening together without fighting about licenses vs. commercial vs. idealistic vs. my-code-is-larger-than-yours vs. GPL vs. ASL might seem a tall order, but we did it very nicely. _No bullshit_ has been our recurring theme on that night.

Too bad I forgot to bring a camera...next time guys!
