From the ROFL department, [Rick Jelliffe's post](http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200611/msg00220.html) about XML schema wars is a must read. Of course...the other is the Middle East.

This comes in response to Elliotte Rusty Harold's [RELAX Wins](http://cafe.elharo.com/xml/relax-wins/) and Tim Bray's [Choose RELAX Now](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/27/Choose-Relax) posts. Go read them if you're not yet convinced that XML Schema sucks.

Boring technology is rarely good technology: XML Schema proves this.
