title: "Java works on Intel-based Macs...says James Gosling himself"

Now that the Intel-based Macs are out, James Gosling is allowed to [tell us](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jag?entry=the_new_macintoshes) that Java works and that the transition was "boring, as it should".

He doesn't say how fast the JVM runs on these machines though, but _any_ faster would be good already. Compiling Cocoon on a Powerbook besides someone who's using an Intel-based laptop is embarassing enough ;-)
