Looking for hosted bugzilla, jira or similar services, for a colleague who has trouble getting over the corporate dictators to install issue tracking software at his shop.

Found [AdminiTrack](http://www.adminitrack.com), looks interesting at first sight.

If anyone has experience with such services, please let me know.
