Imagine this scenario:

1\. Spammer posts comment here.  
2\. Movable Type sends notification email to me. Powerful.  
3\. SpamAssassin recognizes email as spam due to its content, deletes it. Powerful.

Well, a little too powerful actually: it means I don't get notifications for some spamming comments made here.

For now, I'm just going to check the comments list from time to time, delete spam comments and retaliate on their authors with another powerful tool (I'm not telling ;-)

So, if you (legitimate readers) see funny comments here, just turn on your visual spam filters on.

Comments have brought me more good than bad until now (thanks [Tom](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/tomk/) for the [cybertool](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000150.html)!), I'm not going to turn them off, think I'll just wait for the next version of MovableType which is supposed to include [spam filters](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/10/comment_spam.shtml).
