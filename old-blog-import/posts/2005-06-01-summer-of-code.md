Yesterday Google announced the [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html) initiative, where students can receive a $4500 award for completing an open source project by the end of Summer.

Various open source organizations are participating by proposing projects and providing mentors, and the [ASF](http://apache.org) has started a [list of projects](http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2005) which will certainly grow in the next few days.

I have suggested one project about [Automatic generation of XML-based reference documentation](http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2005#cocoon-refdoc), using Cocoon to generate reference docs for itself or other projects. This is something that I've been working on lately with the help of a yet mysterious _Doktor_, and it would be a really cool way of generating docs without having to duplicate information. I hope to have more details soon, we'll talk about it when I have actual code to show.
