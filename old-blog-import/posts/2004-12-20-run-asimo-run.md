Honda posts a [video](http://www.world.honda.com/HDTV/ASIMO/200412-run/index.html) of their Asimo robot running. 3kph they say, but it's a start, and the "human" look of it is very impressive.

Truly amazing (unless someone's hiding in it of course ;-), but a bit scary when put in parallel with [this](http://airbornecombatengineer.typepad.com/airborne_combat_engineer/2004/12/a_talon_robot_g.html).
