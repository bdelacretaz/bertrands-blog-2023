Very insightful keynote by someone who...well someone who is hard to categorize in a few words as he's done so much for the web at large. Have a look at his [homepage](http://roy.gbiv.com/) if you don't know who Roy is. Here are just a few random notes.

A quotable statement with which I fully agree: _XForms and several other w3c recommendations are not used because they are not simple enough_. Note that Roy didn't say _too complicated_ - very polite of him.

He also noticed that no one is touting SOAP-based web services as the Next Big Thing That Will Solve Everything anymore - but at the same time, practical web services are appearing everywhere, based much more on REST principles than the SOAP. In his words, REST has won - I agree and it is Good News - simplicity wins once again.

Roy also mentioned [WHAT](http://whatwg.org/), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. These people take a pragmatic view to the problem of rich web applications, proposing solutions based on HTML, which can apparently be easily implemented in today's browsers. Something to follow for sure...

_Update: [Arje](http://blogs.hippowebworks.com/hippo/archives/000054.html) has posted his own impressions of Roy's talk_
