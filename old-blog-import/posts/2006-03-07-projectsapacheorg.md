Thanks to [David Reid](http://www.david-reid.com/) and the site-dev folk for their great [work](http://www.david-reid.com/cynic/?p=392) on [projects.apache.org](http://projects.apache.org/)!

You'll find a centralized source of information about all [ASF](http://apache.org) projects there, assuming the projects have created the required [information files](http://projects.apache.org/guidelines.html).
