[Andrew](http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/archives/000156.html) notes that the very best speakers use slides [and](http://www.orixo.com/events/gt2003/sessions.html#david) a piano. Hmm, maybe I should do my next presentation on drums. It might have more impact (at least if you're sitting inside the bass drum ;-)

[Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/12/15/PPt-Keynote) recommends _getting away from the idea that slides are the content of your presentation_. I couldn't agree more, this makes my own [thoughts](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000076.html) clearer. As Tim puts it: Just Say No To Bullets!
