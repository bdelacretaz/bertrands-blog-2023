[Tufte's booklet](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000053.html) on slideware arrived and it lives up to my expectations.

Basically, the message is that typical PowerPoint slides convey extremely little information, but (quoting Tufte) _the damage is mitigated since meetings relying on the PP cognitive style may not matter all that much_. At least these meetings have a consistent concept then: say nothing, and use inefficient tools to say it...

He also uses the enlightening [Gettysburg PowerPoint presentation](http://www.norvig.com/Gettysburg/making.html) as an example. I'm burning my PowerPoint CDROM as we speak ;-)
