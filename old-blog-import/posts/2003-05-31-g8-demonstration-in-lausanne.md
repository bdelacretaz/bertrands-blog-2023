More pictures [here](http://www.vaccum.ch/photo/g8/manif_lsne/) (not from me, I stayed home, busy photographing the [puppies](http://chienchien.bestiole.ch)).

The demonstration went ok, the demonstrators (is that the right word?) had their own police who were able to keep order and avoid damage to private properties. Kudos to them!

[This picture](http://www.vaccum.ch/photo/g8/manif_lsne/tn/DSC00014.JPG.html) shows the gigantic metal wall that has been setup just to protect a small area at the lake, apparently where the helis are going to land when the various presidents and bigwigs arrive.

Obviously the question that comes to mind is _wouldn't a videoconference be cheaper_;-)
