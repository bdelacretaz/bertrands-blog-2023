Among the Cocoon team we had some talks about Learning Objects last year - the [Burrokeet](http://www.burrokeet.org/) projects aims to create an integrated system to manage Learning Content, combining documents, movies and interactive mini-applications into shareable units.

Very interesting - and it's based on [Forrest](http://forrest.apache.org) (which is in turn based on [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org), but you know this already, right?).
