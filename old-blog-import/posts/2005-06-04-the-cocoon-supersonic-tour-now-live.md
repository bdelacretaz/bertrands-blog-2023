If you've been waiting for sooo long to try the _Cocoon Supersonic Tour_ interactive tutorial, it's now live on the [Cocoon Zone](http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/).

We've just started to setup live Cocoon demos on this (virtual) machine, and some links and samples are still broken.

But most of the Tour works, so if you want to have a good overview of Cocoon in less than an hour, just go [there](http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/).

The Bean Editor demo does not work from the supplied link but you can start it from [this link](http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/demos/release/samples/blocks/tour/bean-editor/view/allTasks), until we fix it (of course this doesn't make sense unless you're following the corresponding [tutorial](http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/demos/release/samples/blocks/tour/bean-editor/docs/index.html)).
