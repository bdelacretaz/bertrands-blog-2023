Looks like Carsten has [released](http://www.osoco.net/weblogs/rael/archives/000270.html) Cocoon 2.1.5, which should get to the various mirrors soon.

The ASF mail servers don't seem to be delivering mail today, though, so the discussion is not as lively as usual ;-)

Anyway: Thanks Carsten, and congratulations for the release!
