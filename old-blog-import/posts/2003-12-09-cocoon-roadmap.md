Bugzilla strikes again: Reinhard Poetz has been setting up a nice [Cocoon Roadmap](http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/showdependencytree.cgi?id=25320) based on bugzilla dependencies. Cocoonistas should make this their homepage, for sure ;-)

This follows our discussions at the [Cocoon GetTogether](http://orixo.com/events/gt2003/sessions.html#bertrand) and on the mailing lists - It is great to see bugzilla being used more seriously by the Cocoon community!

I'm sure this will be a big help once the community gets used to it and finds a balance between having discussions on the mailing lists and in bugzilla issues.
