The canton of Geneva is sending all its taxpayers a CDROM with its free multiplatform [GEtax software](http://www.getax.ch).  

It won't help if you live outside this canton (sorry [Ovidiu](http://www.webweavertech.com/ovidiu/weblog/archives/000194.html)), as even inside Switzerland there are something like 26 tax systems, but if you ask me they deserve the "Ã¼bercool tax office" award.  
Even better, as there was some space left on the CD they included versions of Mozilla and OpenOffice for their taxpayer's pleasure.  
There is some info in english on [slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/02/15/1535208&mode=thread&tid=154&tid=98).  
It's great to see a tax office being so open-minded here, where people are often sooooo conservative.  
(but hey, we have [Alinghi](http://www.alinghi.com) as well!)
