[Russel Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1004713.html) has some words on the soon-to-be macosx upgrade. I like the picture as well!

I have to agree with Russell - I'm perfectly ok with the idea of forking a small amount of money from time to time to get a good OS upgrade.

We're getting closer to the "IT as a utility" model. Products are out, services are in.
