[Mads Toftum](http://www.toftum.dk/) was recently [interviewed](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/06/Apache-Server) by Tim Bray about the ASF zones server, and gives some insights about its administration.

The server they're talking about is the one that powers (among others) the [Cocoon zone](http://cocoon.zones.apache.org).

This is a very useful addition to the ASF's infrastructure, many thanks to Sun (and to our [other donators](http://apache.org/foundation/thanks.html))! And don't forget that there are [many ways](http://apache.org/foundation/contributing.html) to help the [ASF](http://apache.org) if you feel like you should.
