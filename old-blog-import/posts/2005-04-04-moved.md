The move to my new server is complete, looks like everything works fine. And the Movable Type search, which had been behaving funnily for [a long time](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000346.html), is back, after [converting](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000490.html) the storage to MySQL.

Moving servers feels a bit like emptying the storage cabinet, throwing away what you don't need and putting the rest back in. A Good Thing when done, a lot of work to do properly.

The people at [Bytemark](http://www.bytemark.co.uk/) have been very quick to answer the few questions that I had on the way, mostly due to their unusual (for me) [TinyDNS](http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html) server . Thanks! Their virtual servers are not the [cheapest](http://www.bytemark.co.uk/hosting/prices/index.html) but mine feels very solid, with good connectivity and competent people to back it up.

Very different from my experience at [greatnet.de](http://greatnet.de/), where I'm trying to get my account canceled but those guys are just slow or don't care...definitely _not_ recommended.

Now back to our usual program...
