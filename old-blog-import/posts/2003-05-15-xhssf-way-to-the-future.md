> With XHSSF, the Horrible structures of HSSF can be accessed in XML form using common tools, lowering HEI costs dramatically by allowing HEI applications to exchange Horrible Structures and the corresponding Implementation Nightmares (IN) directly, allowing INs to spread faster through HEI networks.
