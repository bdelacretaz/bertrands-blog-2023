Myth or reality? This [paper](http://www.imperva.com/docs/Application_Worms.pdf) at [imperva.com](http://www.imperva.com/application_defense_center/white_papers/) shows how relatively simple techniques can be used to automatically find and attack vulnerable application servers. Looks plausible enough to me.

You've been warned: use a [serious](http://cocoon.apache.org) framework for your next project ;-)
