The [LOTS](http://www.lots.ch) Open-Source event will take place in Bern, Switzerland on February 18th.

Many interesting talks and workshops are planned, (mostly in German), and several [ASF](http://apache.org) people will be there: Giacomo Pati will give a [talk](http://lots.ch/Programm_Referate.html) about how the ASF works, [Gregor J. Rothfuss](http://greg.abstrakt.ch/archives/001586.html) and Andreas Hartmann from [Wyona](http://www.wyona.com) will present a Lenya [workshop](http://lots.ch/Workshops.html) and I'm going to host another one about [Cocoon](http://lots.ch/Supersonic_Tour_of_Apache_Cocoon.html) and talk about [lightweight project management tools](http://lots.ch/Programm_Referate.html).
