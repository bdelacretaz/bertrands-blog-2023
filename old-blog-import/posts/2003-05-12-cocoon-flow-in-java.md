Via [Ovidiu](http://www.webweavertech.com/ovidiu/weblog/archives/000256.html): [here](http://www.freeroller.net/page/alexkrut/20030511) is an implementation of the Cocoon Flow layer using java as the flow control language, written by Alex Krut _over the weekend_.

Looks like the [continuation engine](http://www.velare.com/product/atct.htm) used is not Open-Source though. Ovidiu mentions [Brakes](http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~tim/MOS/brakes.html) which as I understand it could be used for java-based continuations as well.

The _over the weekend_ bit says a lot about the modularity of Cocoon, Avalon and about the quality of the current Flow implementation!
