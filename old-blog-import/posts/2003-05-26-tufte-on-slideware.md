I've seen so many bad slides-based presentations in my life (who hasn't?) that it took me about 14 seconds to order [The Cognitive Style of Powerpoint](http://www.edwardtufte.com/1472288704/tufte/books_pp) after seeing Aaron Swartz's cool [remix](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000931).

Tufte's books are part of my "desert island" book collection: If like me you like graphics, you should read at least _Envisioning Information_ which is presented as a book that _celebrates escapes from the flatlands of both paper and computer screen_. Sounds like marketing but I find it very true in this case.
