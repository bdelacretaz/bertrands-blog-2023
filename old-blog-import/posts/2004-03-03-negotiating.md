[Ben Hyde](http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/) publishes a very interesting [list](http://www.cozy.org/yes.html) of tools and strategies for _getting to yes_ (apparently summarized from a [book](http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/example/fish7513.htm)).

This comes just right as this morning I'll have to negociate a situation where I feel ripped off. We'll see if this works: _a good agreement is one which is wise and efficient, and which improves the parties' relationship_.
