Got an email from Mandriva which looked suspiciously like the stuff Mandrake was sending before, and my suspicion was right: [Mandriva](http://www.mandrivalinux.com/) is the new name for the-linux-distro-formerly-known-as-mandrake.

Looks like a conflict with [Hearst Holdings](http://www.kingfeatures.com/pressrm/rel_157_24_2_2004.htm) over the Mandrake name played a big part in the name change, the [press release](http://www.mandriva.com/company/press/pr?n=/pr/corporate/2551) has all the details.

Having helped select a few product and company names in the last few years, I know it is very hard today to find a good name that Google doesn't know and for which domain names are available. But still, _Mandrake_ sounded much better to me, especially for someone who read Mandrake the Magician in his youth ;-)
