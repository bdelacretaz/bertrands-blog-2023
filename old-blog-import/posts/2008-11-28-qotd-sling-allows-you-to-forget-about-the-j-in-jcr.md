_Sling allows you to forget about the "J" in "JCR"_ - I love that quote from Adam Constabaris's excellent [Apache Sling Overview](http://www.unc.edu/home/adamc/sling-overview.html) slides.

I'm sure the Siing project would welcome such contributions (and Adam's [Sling POST servlet](http://www.unc.edu/home/adamc/post-servlet.html) description as well) as part of our (currently lacking) documentation. Hear, hear!
