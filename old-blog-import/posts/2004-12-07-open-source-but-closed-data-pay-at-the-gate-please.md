[Torsten](http://vafer.org/blog/tcurdt/archives/000164.html) reports on insecure.com's...mmmm....say _funny_ interpretation of what open source is. I'm not linking to them ,they don't deserve it.

Basically, you need a license to read _data files_ generated by their nmap utility, or to _execute nmap and parse the results_.

I'll repeat Torsten's words, there's not much more to say: _"I am so pissed off"_.
