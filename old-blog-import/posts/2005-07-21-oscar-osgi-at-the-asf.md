A recent [proposal](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=incubator-general&m=112138556805125&w=2) was made to bring the [Oscar](http://oscar.objectweb.org/) implementation of the [OSGI](http://www.osgi.org/) framework to the ASF incubator.

Given [our](http://cocoon.apache.org) recent [experiments](http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/Blockathon2005Report) with OSGI, the timing couldn't be better!
