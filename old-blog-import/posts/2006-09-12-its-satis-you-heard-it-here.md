I'm not quite sure what SATIS, the [Studentische Arbeitsgruppe gegen Tiermissbrauch im Studium](http://www.satis.tierrechte.de/satis/ags.htm) (student's workgroup against animal abuse in studies) has to do with this blog, but something tells me that I'll find out soon.

Life is full of mysteries, but some of them are more linked in than others...
