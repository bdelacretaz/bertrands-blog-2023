Living at 700 meters altitude means I have to drive a car (instead of my bike) in such wintery times. The (almost only) good point is the sound system, makes rides more enjoyable.

I just got Maceo Parker's latest CD in the mail, [Made by Maceo](http://maceo.com/madebymaceo/index.html) and it rocks (or rather _funks_)!

Drummers and bass players beware: listening to this might either make you want to go back to fishing instead of music, or prompt you to work on your groove. You've been warned!
