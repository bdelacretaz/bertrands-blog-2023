The call for papers for [ApacheCon US 2007](http://www.us.apachecon.com/) (Atlanta, GA, 14, 15 & 16 November, 2007) opened a few days ago and will close on _Monday, April 30th_ already (despite the website saying April 23rd, it's a typo apparently).

So the time is short to bring new and improved speakers to the game - but if you read this it's maybe not too late to [submit a talk](http://apachecon.com/html/login.html).

And before that we'll be in Amsterdam (see Steven Pemberton and Astrid Kerssens [guide](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/amsterdam.html) if you're new to the area) next week for [ApacheCon EU 2007](http://eu.apachecon.com/). See [you](http://eu.apachecon.com/program/talk/84) [there](http://eu.apachecon.com/program/talk/34)!
