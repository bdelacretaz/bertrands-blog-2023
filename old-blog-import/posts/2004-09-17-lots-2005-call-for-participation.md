The call for participation is now open at [http://www.lots.ch](http://www.lots.ch).

About the language: last year most talks were in German and 95% of the people were German-speaking, but for 2005 (and it is my main role in the LOTS team ;-) we'd like more French-speaking people (from the Western part of the country) to join the event. Either as speakers or attendees.

So, if you're planning to do a presentation there, it's hard to tell at this stage which of of English or German is better - but my personal preference is English as this gives more chances of bringing people from out here (who are often reluctant towards German - obwohl ich selbst kein Problem habe).

_Update: forgot to mention that **French** is of course welcome for presentations as well ;-)_
