I know - you've probably [heard](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/crafterm/archives/002493.html) [it](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/002494.html) [elsewhere](http://grumet.net/weblog/archives/2004/11/09/001176.html) [already](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/mitchell/archives/2004/11/firefox_10_now_1.html).

Still, this is a small step for the Open Source world...you know the rest.

Big big congratulations to the firefox team!

[Here](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/archives/006866.html) are some words from Ben Goodger, Firefox's lead engineer. He's only 24 years old by the way, according to this [interview](http://news.com.com/2102-1032_3-5406708.html?tag=st.util.print). Gotta do something good before I get old ;-)

As they say: _Rediscover the Web -- [Get Firefox](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.0/)_. In case their website has a hard time in the next few days here's a [bittorrent](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.0/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%201.0.exe.torrent) link.

Can you tell I'm enthusiastic about this?
