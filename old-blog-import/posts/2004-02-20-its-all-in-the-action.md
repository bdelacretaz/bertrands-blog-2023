Berin Loritsch has [wise words](http://jroller.com/page/bloritsch/20040219#action_vs_planning) on action vs. planning, notably:

> The less experienced you are, the more you need to experience _(I think he means experiment)_ so that you can learn strategies to deal with the mistakes you have made.

To which I'd add: the less experienced you are _about your particular problem_, the more you need to experiment.

Projets where you're tackling new stuff or where (as is often the case) requirements are unclear benefit a lot from agile processes. It's not only the people's seniority that comes into play, but also the "novelty" aspects of the job.
