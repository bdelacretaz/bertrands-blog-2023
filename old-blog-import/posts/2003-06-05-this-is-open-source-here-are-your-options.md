Quoting [Jeremias Maerki](http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?JeremiasMaerki) on the [fop-user](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=fop-user&m=105479608232655&w=2) mailing list, talking about some problem in FOP:

_If the work-around doesn't work for you, you have several options:_

_- This is OpenSource, you can do it yourself.
- This is OpenSource, you can wait until someone has free time and thinks this is fun to implement.
- You can find/hire someone to do it for you._

Right on, Jeremias! Obviously this also applies to [jfor](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000068.html).

_Update: shared neurons in the air as [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/) would say, he finds some [additional wisdom](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/000975.html) on avalon-dev. Trackbacking him like crazy today ;-)_
