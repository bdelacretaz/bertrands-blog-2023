I'm still (at least mentally) working on my blog-in-french project, in the meantime if you care about free software and understand French go read Tristan Nitot's latest [post about lestelechargements.com](http://standblog.org/blog/2006/02/23/93114676-lestelechargementscom-et-le-logiciel-libre). Hilarious in a way, but a bit scary as well.

I agree with Tristan about the price...180'000 euro sounds a bit steep for a slightly improved blog. Me, I'd happily do it for 179'000 ;-)
