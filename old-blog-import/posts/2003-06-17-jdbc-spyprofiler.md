[P6Spy](http://www.p6spy.com/) is an Open-Source framework to intercept JDBC database statements, which apparently works as a wrapper around your real JDBC driver. Cool!

Out-of-the box applications include logging and monitoring for "dead" statements, and the Jahia people have released an [SQL profiling tool](http://www.jahia.org/jahia/page377.html) based on this framework.

Thanks Markus for the tip!
