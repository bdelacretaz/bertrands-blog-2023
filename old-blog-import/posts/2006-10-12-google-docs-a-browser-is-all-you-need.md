[Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) combines text documents and spreadsheets in a unified interface, with PDF export for decent printable versions.

Editing is versioned, and collaboration features are built in - so this is geared towards getting things done, as opposed to spending hours polishing paragraph spacing and figthing with page breaks. Sweet.

This is a nice step towards getting rid of bloated computers and software and having just a browser to cover most people's needs. The network is _really_ becoming the computer.
