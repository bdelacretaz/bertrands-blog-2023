Five hundred posts. Some worthless chit-chat, some notes to self, many references to other people's cool stuff, and a few small bricks to build a better bazaar. Some new friends I probably wouldn't have met otherwise - this is the best part for sure. Many ideas becoming clearer after putting them in writing. And even if it was _all_ crap - I love writing.

It started on [November 6, 2002](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000002.html), with post 02. How about post 01? Never mind, I should have started at 42 anyway.

Hope you enjoy reading when you feel like it, but anyway I've long ago decided not to set any editorial goals. Just my voice in a small corner, take what you like and throw away the rest. Thanks for being here.
