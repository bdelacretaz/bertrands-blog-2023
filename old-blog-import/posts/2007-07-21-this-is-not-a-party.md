![bbq-stuff.jpg](images/bbq-stuff.jpg)Not yet at least: today is Barbecue Sauce Refill Day here: I started doing my own a few months ago, and tomorrow we're meeting a [world-class expert](http://kemppro.com/), so I'm eager to have his opinion!

As said expert is (mostly) mute about what he puts in his sauce, I'm based my own on the [Arkansas](http://www.astray.com/recipes/?show=Arkansas%20bbq%20sauce%20(2gal)) recipe, with some personal variations.

When you start coooking it, a smell so strong as to be almost unbearable is a good indication of success, and it's the case right now, so I'm looking forward to the result ;-)
