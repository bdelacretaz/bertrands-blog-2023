[readyset.tigris.org](http://readyset.tigris.org/) publishes a well thought-out and evolving set of document templates for project artifacts (via [Lars Trieloff](http://trieloff.net/docbook/archive/000619.html)).

I've been using swiss [Hermes](http://www.isb.admin.ch/internet/hermes/produkte/01564/index.html?lang=fr) document models in several projects over the years. They are also good, but hermes adds a lot of extra baggage not well suited to lightweight and/or XP projects. And Hermes documents are not available in English.
