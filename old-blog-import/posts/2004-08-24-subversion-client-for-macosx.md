Very convenient self-installers can be found at [metissian.com](http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/) - I started with fink but it needed to download about 10243 additional packages, this is much easier.

_Update: Pier Fumagalli mentions [scplugin](http://scplugin.tigris.org/), a macosx Finder plugin for Subversion (CVS support is planned) - need to have a look._
