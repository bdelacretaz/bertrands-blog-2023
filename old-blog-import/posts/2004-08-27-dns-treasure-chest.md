[Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/002071.html) shares very useful DNS-related info.

The managed DNS hosting offered by [dnspark](http://www.dnspark.com/) looks very useful combined with virtual hosting, and the tools found at [DNSstuff](http://www.dnsstuff.com/) (some of them I'd been using before) look like the swiss army knife of DNS.

Thanks mate (trying with that aussie accent ;-)
