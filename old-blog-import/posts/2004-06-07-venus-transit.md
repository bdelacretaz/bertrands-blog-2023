Altough it would make a cool name, _Venus Transit_ is not (AFAIK) a new heavy metal band: tomorrow, the planet Venus is going to pass in front of the Sun, as seen from here.

More info [here](http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/sunearthday/2004/vt_observe_2004.htm). The site lists various ways to observe this safely.

I've been successfully using piles of exposed photo film to look at the sun in the past (usual disclaimer: do this at your own risk), without any problem. But [these pictures](http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlkop/venus/transit.html), make it look like Venus might a bit small to be easily visible to the naked eye.

The transit will start around 5:20 UTC and last until 11:24 UTC.
