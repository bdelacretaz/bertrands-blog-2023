I created this little jingle a while ago to try out GarageBand, with [FeatherCast](http://feathercast.org/) in mind.

Rich Bowen recently started using it for the last episodes, I'm honored, thanks Rich! [FeatherCast](http://feathercast.org/) has got some fresh interviews from ApacheCon there, don't miss them!
