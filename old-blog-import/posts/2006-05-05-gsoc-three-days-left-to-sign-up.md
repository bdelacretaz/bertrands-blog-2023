Students applications for the [Google Summer Of Code](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html) have to be in before May 8th 13:00 PDT.

The project suggestions of the [ASF](http://apache.org) are available on the [SummerOfCode2006 wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2006) - but any bright idea is welcome.

_Update: the deadline has been [extended](http://code.google.com/) to today, Tuesday, May 9th, 11:00 PDT, so there are still a few hours left to sign up._
