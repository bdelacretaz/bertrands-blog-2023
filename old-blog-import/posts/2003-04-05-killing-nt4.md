_Either way you look at it, Microsoft is presenting a strong case against its own product line._  
The quote is from this [article](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=620&u=/nf/20030404/bs_nf/21199&printer=1) on Yahoo!news, talking about Microsoft's decision or unability to patch a denial-of-service security hole in NT4, effectively showing their desire to kill the product, altough they're meant to support it until 2005.

The good thing is, this makes a strong argument for Open-Source: Microsoft demonstrates once again that being able to fix systems without relying to the good will of vendors is a definite advantage in IT.

Thanks to [Marc](http://radio.weblogs.com/0116284/) for pointing this article out.
