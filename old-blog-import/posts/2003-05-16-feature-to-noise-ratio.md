title: "Feature to Noise ratio"

Someone [asks](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=105306727608109&w=2) what FS means on cocoon-dev (and no it's not _Full of Something_).

Googling for a good definition I find [this](http://www.manleylabs.com/Manley_mastering.html) one which I like: _"Each feature brings in a penalty of a possible compromise in signal quality"_.

So, let's improve the signal-to-noise ratio of our software...

_update: I [stand corrected](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=105306807108788&w=2), in Cocoonspeak the official meaning of FS is [flexibility syndrome](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&w=2&r=3&s=flexibility+syndrome&q=b), not Feature Syndrome as I thought._
