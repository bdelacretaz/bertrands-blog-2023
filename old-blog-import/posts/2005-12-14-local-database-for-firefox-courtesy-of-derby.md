The more I read about [ApacheCon US 2005](http://apachecon.com/2005/US/index.html) the more I miss not being there...

Ted Leung writes about a [demo](http://www.sauria.com/blog/2005/12/13#1440) of [Derby](http://db.apache.org/derby/) used as a local database for Firefox. Including javascript access for Ajax apps.

Now, add intelligent synchronisation of this database with reliable server-side storage and...I don't like the Web 2.0 hype but we do live in exciting times!

_Update: there's more info on [Fran√ßois Orsini's Blog](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/FrancoisOrsini?entry=derby_apachecon_demo). Subscribed._
