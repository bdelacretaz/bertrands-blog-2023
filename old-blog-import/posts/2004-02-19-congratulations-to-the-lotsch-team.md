Thanks [Michael, Urs and Matthias](http://lots.ch/LOTS-Veranstalter.html) for setting up the [event](http://lots.ch/)!

I had a great time, and feeling the enthusiasm of 500 people gathering around the subject of Open Source was a thrill.

If you map the attendance to the size of the countries, 500 people would translate to 20'000 in the USA. Travel distances would certainly mean a smaller number, but still, this is serious!

Too bad the french part of Switzerland (which is about 1/4 of our population) did not show up, hopefully there will be more enthusiasm this side of the roeschtigraben next time.

The most amazing thing for me was when I asked how many publish a weblog among the audience of my [talk](http://lots.ch/Programm_Referat_Detail.html?id=2004.1.R.25): out of about 80 people, only three raised their hand. I might want to do a talk specifically on weblogs next time ;-)
