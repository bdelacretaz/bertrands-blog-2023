The [Sun Java Desktop System](http://wwws.sun.com/software/learnabout/desktopsystem/index.html) looks really cool to me, but, according to them, consists of _...a GNOME desktop environment, StarOffice Office Productivity Suite, Mozilla browser, Evolution mail and calendar, Java 2 Standard Edition and a Linux operating system..._. Did you spot Java in this? Yes it is there. But _Java_ Desktop System? Really?

At least SCO cannot sue them for using the Java name ;-)
