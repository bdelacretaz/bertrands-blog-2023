Looking for a [GoogleWhack](http://www.googlewhack.com) I find [neurologist clavinet](http://www.google.ch/search?q=neurologist+clavinet&hl=xx-bork&lr=&ie=UTF-8&output=search) after just two tries. Even better, the [single result](http://starling.rinet.ru/music/wonder.htm) is about someone that I like a lot!

But wait..too bad, dictionary.com [doesn't know](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=clavinet) what a [clavinet](http://www.gti.net/junebug/clavinet/) is. Are they kidding? The funkiest instrument known to man?

Also, once this page comes up in [Google](http://www.google.com) my [GoogleWhack](http://www.googlewhack.com/) is toast. Can't win every time.
