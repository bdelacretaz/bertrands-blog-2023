Preparing my [Open Development in the Enterprise](http://na.apachecon.com/schedule/presentation/136/) talk for [ApacheCon NA 2013](http://na.apachecon.com) in Portland the week after, I've tried to capture the basic wisdoms of day-to-day work in an Open Development environment:

_If it didn't happen on the dev list, it didn't happen._

_Whatever you're working on, it must be backed by an issue in the tracker._

_If it's not in the source code control system, it doesn't exist._

_If it's important, it needs a permanent URL._

_What happened while you were away? Check the activity stream and archives._

As usual, following recipes without understanding what they're about won't help - I use those wisdoms just as a reminder of how things are supposed to happen, or more precisely how people are supposed to communicate.
