Congratulations to the recently elected [board](http://apache.org/foundation/board)!

And big thanks to those who left the board after serving for several (or many) years. Managing the growth in number of people and projects has been a big task in the recent years, and you've done a great job - thanks!

Congrats to new foundation members as well, though I don't think we have an official list for those, or not yet at least.
