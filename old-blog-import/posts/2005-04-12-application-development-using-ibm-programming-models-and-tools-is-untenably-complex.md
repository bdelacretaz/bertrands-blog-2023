So IBM is working on [Radical simplification of software development](http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/wwwr_seminar.nsf/pages/sem_abstract_317.html).

And according to [Sam Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/04/12/Radical-Simplification) this means asking questions like _Do we **really** need "middleware"?_.

Have a look at Sam's [slides](http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/rs/), they're worth _going to_.
