![its-about-integrity.jpg](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/its-about-integrity.jpg)If you have _some_ interest in Open Source, go read Matthew's [Surviving the five year itch](http://www.silentpenguin.com/archives/2005/10/eurooscon_day_2.html) presentation from [EuroOSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/) (the slides are [here](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/presentations/euos2005/langham_matt.pdf)).

The slides are obviously a bit dry without the presenter's talk to go with them, but they still paint a very interesting picture of what the Open Source world and way of working can bring to a company.

And I _love_ Matthew's conclusion (so much that I have reproduced the last slide here): _it's about integrity_.
