_Grab the nearest book. Open the book to page 23. Find the fifth sentence. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions._

Couldn't happen on a better day as I just came in with this big heavy bag of books, starting to move my tech library from home to office.

Here you go: _I said: maybe that is the right thing to do, but maybe not._

Fabulous quote, isn't it? ;-)

From Lou Gerstner's _Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround_. I read this during a holiday last year and found it entertaining and in many ways enlightening.
