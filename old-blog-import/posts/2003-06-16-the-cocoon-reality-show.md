It's all becoming [crystal clear](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/) now. Of course! [these](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103021/2003/06/12.html#a1122) [guys](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/gianugo/archives/000989.html) are preparing the release of the first Open-Source [reality show](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/).

Read closely between the lines and the scenario is obvious: programmers wearing [kimonos](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/000984.html) will be locked in a remote Belgian programming room with sufficient supply of fries and beer. Their mission (should they accept it) consists of rewriting [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org/) for [dot net](http://microsoft.com/net/), to cause less friction when the project is later moved to [its new home](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000075.html). The first one who has to reinstall his workstation (due to [user error](http://www.cantrip.org/nobugs.html) of course) gets [fired](http://content.monster.com/tools/quizzes/firing/).

I'll be tuning in to MTV around noon, for sure. This will be so much more fun than professional Open-Source support ;-)

_Update #1: seems like the poor geeks will be allowed to spend some time in a nice garden every day. [pictures](http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/archives/000024.html) are expected soon._

_Update #2: forgot about the [French wing](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/archives/000052.html) of the production team. Sylvain sounds like he wants to give some training to the poor contestants beforehand._
