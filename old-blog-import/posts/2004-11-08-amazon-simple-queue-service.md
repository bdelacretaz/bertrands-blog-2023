The [Amazon Simple Queue Service](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_7/104-4126696-6557513?%5Fencoding=UTF8&node=13584001&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA) is a nice step towards actually useful web services. In my opinion, the big problem at the moment is the lack of a simple and reliable micropayment service: assuming more such services become available, juggling subscriptions so that they don't expire at the wrong time could be a pain.
