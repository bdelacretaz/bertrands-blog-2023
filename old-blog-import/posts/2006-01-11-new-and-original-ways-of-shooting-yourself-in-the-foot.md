Don't you love good writing? Here's one from my almost-neighbor [Ceki Gülcü](http://www.qos.ch) from his [Taxonomy of class loader problems encountered when using Jakarta Commons Logging](http://www.qos.ch/logging/classloader.jsp). I haven't studied the technical aspects yet, but his writing is delicious:

> JCL's discovery mechanism invents new and original ways of shooting yourself in the foot. For example, with JCL you can shoot yourself in the foot while aiming at the sky. Thanks to JCL you can be hit by lightning in the middle of the desert when it's not raining. If your computing life is too dull and trouble is what you are looking for, then JCL is the way to go.
