Combine the power of weblogs with the clout of someone like Tim Bray and you get [this](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/01/WhatNext): _hey world, I'm looking for a job and here's why such-and-such should hire me_.

This is [cluetrain](http://www.cluetrain.com/) at its best: no need for someone of value to go through headhunters or anything, just let the cluetrainy world know you're available. It will be interesting to see what happens to Tim next.

_Update: Tim has [gone public](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/15/SunnyBoy) with his new job at Sun, including wise words on his "Java Rocks, Microsoft Sucks" mantra (I write his so you won't know if I share his views or not ;-)_
