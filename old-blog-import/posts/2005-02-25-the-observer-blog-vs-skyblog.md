[Ben Hammersley](http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2005/02/22/the_observer_blog.html) introduces [The Observer Blog](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/observer/index.html), and my (easy) guess is that we're going to see more and more professional press people going in this direction. Via [Matthew](http://www.silentpenguin.com/archives/2005/02/building_the_ne.html).

At the other end of the spectrum, [Skyblog](http://www.skyblog.com/) are all the rage among teenagers out here, and it seems like there's a lot of crap in there.

Like on many weblogs...but this might be \*your\* teenagers (I have three of them by the way) publishing their views of you parents on their weblog. So, be kind to them ;-)
