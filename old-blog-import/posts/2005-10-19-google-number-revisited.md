Let's see how people's [Google Numbers](http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/11/23/203120.php) have evolved since [last time](http://www.codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000186.html)...

[Grady Booch](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22grady+booch%22) gets 369'000, up from 27'000 .

[Jesus Christ](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Jesus Christ%22) gets 16'700'000, up from 3,820,000 .

[the Beatles](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22the Beatles%22) get 10'400'000, up from 1,300,000. Still _less_ popular than Jesus Christ according to Google.

[Jerry Pournelle](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Jerry+Pournelle%22) gets 515'000, up from 27'300.

[Bertrand Meyer](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22bertrand+meyer%22) gets 233'000, up from 25,800 .

[Linus Torvalds](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Linus+Torvalds%22%22) gets 6'222'000, up from 627,000. Still wow.

[Pekka Himanen](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Pekka+Himanen%22%22) gets 58'000, up from 6,990.

[William Gibson](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22William+Gibson%22) gets 1'830'000, up from 240'000.

[Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22Tim+Berners-Lee%22%22) gets 1'960'000, up from 92,700. A big increase here.

[C-F Ramuz](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22C-F+Ramuz%22+OR+%22Charles-Ferdinand+Ramuz%22) gets 54'200, up from 3'560. He's still dead since 1947, so that's a remarkable score.

[Yours truly](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22bertrand+delacretaz%22) gets 60'100, up from 4,210. I'm still in front of C-F Ramuz ;-)

Our new contestant is [Daffy Duck](http://www.google.ch/search?q=%22daffy%20duck%22) who gets 909'000.

Most numbers have increased between 10 and 20 times, it will be interesting to see if the trend continues in the next two years. I'd bet for a slower increase for non-web related people, and maybe the same rate for those who "live" on the web. Come back in two years and we'll see what happened...
