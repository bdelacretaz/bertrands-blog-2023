Everything is (hopefully) ready for the [Cocoon GetTogether](http://www.orixo.com/events/gt2003/). 129 people from 16 countries signed up, wow!

The schedule of Monday's [Hackathon](http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=GT2003Hackathon) has been reworked to leave more space for actually hacking in small groups. Among other things, we plan on cleaning up Bugzilla issues to make the list as small as possible.

Looking forward to meet many Cocooners for two exciting days!
