If you read this on [planetapache.org](http://planetapache.org/), the post title most probably says "Bertrand".

This is due to the move of my [blog](http://grep.codeconsult.ch) to [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) hosting: seems like, the planetapache software incorrectly takes the last <title> element of the feed item as the post title, even if it is a _media:title_ as is the case in my [feed](http://grep.codeconsult.ch/feed).

Now I understand why all of Dims' posts there are titled _Davanum_ there, and all of Nick Kew's posts _niq_ ;-)
