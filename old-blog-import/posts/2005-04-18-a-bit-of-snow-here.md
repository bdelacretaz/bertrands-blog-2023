![cugy-snow.jpg](images/cugy-snow.jpg)Yesterday morning we woke up with about 35cm of snow, up from zero on Saturday night . Very uncommon at this time of the year, and it was incredibly wet and heavy. Just don't stay under that roof (and don't leave your Mercedes under it as one neighbour did last year ;-)

The village roads were impassable until noon, as it took some time to figure out _where_ to put all the snow they had to remove!

This morning was much warmer, everything's melting like crazy and I was able to ride my motorbike as usual, but the impression of driving it with so much snow around is really different.
