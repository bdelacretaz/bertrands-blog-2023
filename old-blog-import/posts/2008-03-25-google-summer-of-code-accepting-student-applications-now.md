See the [timeline](http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_timeline), now is the time for students to talk to us (mentors) and to prepare and submit applications.

See the ASF's [list of ideas](http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2008) (where you can find three ideas about [Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling)) or the [list of participating organizations](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/) for more info.
