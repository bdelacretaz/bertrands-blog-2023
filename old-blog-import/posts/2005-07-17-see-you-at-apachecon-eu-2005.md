I'm just back from a great week near Perpignan, south of France, and packing again for [ApacheCon](http://apachecon.com/2005/EU/) in Stuttgart, starting with the [Blockathon](http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/Blockathon) tomorrow. Hope to see you there!

I'll be blogging about the conference during the week, for sure. After soooo many years I finally got a new cell phone which takes (crappy) pictures. So I'll try to post pictures (or at least postage stamps) of what happens there during the week. Stay tuned!
