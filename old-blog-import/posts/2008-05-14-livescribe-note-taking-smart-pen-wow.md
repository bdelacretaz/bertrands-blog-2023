[![livescribe.jpg](images/imageslivescribe.jpg)](http://www.livescribe.com)I wasn't impressed at first when looking at the [livescribe](http://www.livescribe.com/) smart pen hardware specs (although impressive, that's in a way just another smart pen), but the demos made the coin drop: synchronizing audio with smart paper notes sounds like the killer app for smart pens, and that pen seems to do it right. Can't wait to try it!
