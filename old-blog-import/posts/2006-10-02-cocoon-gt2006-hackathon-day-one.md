It's been a great day [here](http://www.cocoongt.org/), extra tables had to be added due to about fifty people showing up.

Not too many big talks, but lots of work and important converstations in small groups, it looks like this is going to be a very productive edition. Me, I've been improving the [zone demos](http://cocoon.zones.apache.org) setup, in-between exchanging ideas with many people.
