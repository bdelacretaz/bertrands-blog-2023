Don Brown [introduces](http://jroller.com/page/mrdon/20040505#introducing_simple_xml_pipeline) a lightweight SAX-based [XML pipeline engine](http://www.twdata.org/pipeline) inspired by Cocoon concepts, but limited to "just" pipelines and (apparently, I did not try) easy to embed.

Via Tony Collen on the dev@cocoon list.
