Yesterday my colleague Michal Marth launched a cool [CMS vendor meme](http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/main/cmsvendormeme.html), challenging other vendors to self-evaluate their products according to the [we-get-it-checklist](http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1518-A-reality-checklist-for-vendors) suggested by [Kas Thomas](http://www.cmswatch.com/Analyst/23-Thomas).

Many vendors have [already responded](http://jonontech.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/celebrity-cms-deathmatch/). Except those who don't know about Twitter or blogs, of course. You don't want to buy from them anyway ;-)

To help people find pages related to this meme around the web, I suggest adding the string `9c56d0fcf93175d70e1c9b9d188167cf` to such pages, so that a [Google query](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=9c56d0fcf93175d70e1c9b9d188167cf) can find them all.

As I said on the dev.day.com post, this number is the md5 of some great software, the first person to tell me which file that is gets a free beer or equivalent beverage!
