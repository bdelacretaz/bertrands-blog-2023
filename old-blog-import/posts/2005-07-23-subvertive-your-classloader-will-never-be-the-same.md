Following the thundering success of his [joint proposal](http://flickr.com/photos/93787850@N00/27763375/in/photostream/) with Santiago Gala at ApacheCon, Upayavira has posted a [project proposal](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=incubator-general&m=112204944709374&w=2) for Subvertive, a _dynamic SVN-based compiling classloader with an extended Google-based dynamic code locator, integrated with IM for quicker response time when fixing bugs_.

I'm proud to be listed as a sponsoring member, and even more to have been part of the initial discussion which lead to this idea. Maybe Carlton Lager would sponsor the project? We'll have to ask them.

My only suggestion at this point would be to give more priority to the JSR submission: this is critical technology for a new generation of _really_ mobile and agile applications, having to wait until April 1st to submit a JSR will be a long time.
