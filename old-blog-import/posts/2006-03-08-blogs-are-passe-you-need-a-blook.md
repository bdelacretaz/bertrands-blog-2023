The [Lulu Blooker Prize](http://www.lulublookerprize.com/) is said to be the _world's first literary prize for [blooks](http://lulublookerprize.typepad.com/lulu_blooker_blog/what_is_a_blook/index.html)_: books created out of blog content.

Of course, [Lulu](http://lulu.com) have some interest in this: they sell self-publishing and print-to-order services ;-)

Still, it's an interesting idea. Like [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html), some bloggers deserve to have their works on paper. But not all of us, maybe ;-)

A [Coyote blog](http://www.coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2005/10/archiving_coyot.html) post gives an example of how this works. I wouldn't do it with Word, but it shows that most anyone can do that.
