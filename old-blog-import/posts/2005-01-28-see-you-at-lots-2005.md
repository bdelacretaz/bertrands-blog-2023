There's only a few days left to [pre-register](http://www.lots.ch/2005/Registration.html) and get a discount for the [LOTS 2005](http://www.lots.ch/2005/index_en.html) conference about Open Source, in Bern, Switzerland, February 17th to 19th.

We're going to have [Stefano Mazzocchi](http://www.lots.ch/2005/Referate.html?id=001) for Friday's keynote (with a mysterious and catchy title...), workshops on Lenya and Apache 2, speeches on Jackrabbit, Cocoon (disclaimer: by yours truly), Popoon (that one in German), extending Apache 2 and a lot of other exciting stuff.

Thursday is for workshops, Friday is the professional conference and Saturday is "Community Day", including a Linux installfest, TuxRacer championships, etoy.com fun, etc.

[We](http://www.lots.ch/2005/Organisationskomitee_und_Vorstand.html) are still finalizing the program for that last day, it will be online soon.

Hope to see some of you there!
