Remember [this one](http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/s/spacepen.htm)? (Well, they say it's fiction anyway).

Today [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/archives/000139.html) is my Russian with his dead-simple comment spam workaround.

You might have noticed that I've just implemented [something](http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/scode.php) much more complex. Damn - I should have gone fishing instead ;-)

Anyway, time will tell if any or both solutions work - for now, things seem to be ok here.
