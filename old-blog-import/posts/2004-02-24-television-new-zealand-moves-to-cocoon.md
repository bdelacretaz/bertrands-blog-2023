According to [this](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/businessstorydisplay.cfm?storyID=3550878), TNZ is replacing a Vignette system by [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org).

They say they're moving to Open-Source to be able to _partner with other suppliers_ instead of relying on in-house skills. Sounds like a business case for consulting in Open-Source, cool!
