After writing **obj** instead for the millionth time I have to vent the steam somwhere. Maybe my fingers will learn after seeing this post ;-)

[OJB](http://db.apache.org/ojb/) works just great for me, but my fingers are soooooooo used to type obj-something...You'll see when you're my age!

(yes, I know I said this before already - my brain cells are not _that_ bad ;-)
