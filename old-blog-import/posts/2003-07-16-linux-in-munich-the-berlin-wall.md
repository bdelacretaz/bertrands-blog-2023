Interesting [article](http://www.usatoday.com/usatonline/20030714/5320229s.htm) in USA today about the fight between Microsoft and Suse for the desktops of Munich.

It seems like Munich ended up paying _more money_ upfront for the Suse Linux solution (after guerilla price cuts from Microsoft). _Upfront_ is the key word here - these guys have obviously done their math.
