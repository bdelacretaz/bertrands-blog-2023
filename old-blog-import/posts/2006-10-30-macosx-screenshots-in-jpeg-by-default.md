As mentioned at [macintouch](http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/macosx10_4_1/topic3075.html), use this setting to change the default format for MacOSX screenshots (cmd-shift-4) to JPEG:

`defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg`

Note that you have to logout and login again to activate the change.
