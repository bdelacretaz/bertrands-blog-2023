Erik Hatcher just added the [NINES collex](http://www.nines.org/collex) site to the [powered by Solr](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers) page.

The faceted browsing implementation is very well done, and doesn't get in the way of Joe User: the interface and terminology used feel natural.

I hate it when search pages try to make you think that "advanced search" has to be complicated, and this one is just the opposite.
