Pier Fumagalli [announces](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=108515696009033&w=2) his first "real" live Cocoon site, [vnunet.com](http://www.vnunet.com/). And real it is!

Pier has already given us some details about the use of Apache httpd caching to keep the whole thing running smoothly, this comes at the right point for me as I'm supposed to start a similar (in functionality, but much smaller) project soon.

Having such big sites run by Cocoon at a company that is very willing to give back to the project is a big plus for the project - thanks Pier and vnu!

_Update: here's the [link](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=108524867813870&w=2) to (a small part of) Pier's wisdom._
