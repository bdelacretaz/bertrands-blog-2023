Well, not exactly dead, but today the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org) elected a new [board of directors](http://apache.org/foundation/board/):

> 2009 board: Shane Curcuru, Doug Cutting, Justin Erenkrantz, Roy T. Fielding, Jim Jagielski, Geir Magnusson, Jr., Brian McCallister, Brett Porter, Greg Stein

Congrats to all! There were a lot of excellent candidates this time, and the new board looks like a nice mix of great people. Looking forward to what this year brings.

And thanks to the outgoing board - being part of it has been a rich learning experience for me. Hard work at times, but it's great to have more insight about how the foundation works and to be able to help.

I'll list the names of the 2008 board here, so that I can find them in 50 years when we talk about the good times:

> 2008 board: Justin Erenkrantz, J Aaron Farr, Jim Jagielski (chairman), Geir Magnusson Jr, William Rowe Jr, Sam Ruby, Henning Schmiedehausen, Greg Stein, Bertrand Delacretaz

Shane Curcuru has created a nice [timeline](http://communityovercode.com/faq/asf-board/) of all board members from the beginning to 2008.
