Interesting experiment today with [JSPWiki](http://www.jspwiki.org/): by configuring it to store files in a CVS sandbox, it is easy to work offline on a local version of the content, and synchronize the content with a central CVS repository when back online.

This makes JSPWiki (or any other Wiki that uses plain files for storage) a great tool for collaborative work: editing can be done either on a local instance of JSPWiki, or directly in the filesystem, making for a a powerful yet very lightweight collaboration system.
