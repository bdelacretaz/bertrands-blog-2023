It is not easy to answer [questions](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=105341599300003&r=1&w=2) about the current weather when the [storm](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=104877211007088&w=2) is not completely over.

But I like the challenge of convincing people when it's for a right cause. After writing [such messages](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=105343342215913&w=2) I'm always eager to see the outcome.

Will it work? Will the (microcosmical) world be better after that? Time will tell...
