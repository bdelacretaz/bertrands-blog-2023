[Matthew](http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001430.html) notices a significant increase of activity regarding LOAF. It's about time.

There's already a cool [Java reference implementation](http://jaseb.net/loaf/) of LOAF, which, after careful study, seems to follow the [LOAF charter](http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~pvg/loaf.txt) principles very closely.

It's one of those things: someday we'll be proud to say "I was there"...

_Update: The first LOAF [interoperability tests](http://www.silent-penguin.com/loaf/loafinterop.html) are in. Well, as with any complex spec, it takes time for people to get the implementation right. Some implementations seem to be able to talk to themselves, though, which is a good sign for such mission-critical technology._
