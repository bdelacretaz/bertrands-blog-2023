Yamaha's [vocaloid](http://www.vocaloid.com) technology sounds amazing, emulating a human singer in software.

This [demo](http://www.yamaha.co.jp/product/vocaloid/en/kimi_no_uwasa_128.mp3) sounds fairly human - although my ears are not used to Japanese singing, it sounds better than many singers already.

A quick glance at the website did not indicate if the software works in realtime, and from some hints I assume it does not. Still an amazing feat though.
