Gregor gets [all of Tufte's work](http://greg.abstrakt.ch/archives/2006/11/gifts.html) as gift, lucky man!

I guess that means books, as E.T.'s [fine art](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/fineart) and [sculptures](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/sculpture) are a bit on the expensive side.

So, to whomever it might concern: I'm still missing [several](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be) [of](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) [them](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_textb) ;-)
