As much as I like the microservices concept (\*) the name does not really make sense to me.

Why would decoupled services necessarily need to be _micro_?

Focusing on a service's size is the wrong crusade for me, I'm happy as long as a service does one thing and one thing well - but that thing might be too large for a _micro_ service.

We had good discussions about this with my colleagues and on Twitter recently, and after some virtual brainstorming it's my good Apache friend [Santi Gala](https://twitter.com/sgala/status/705695405762338817) who came up with the _Federated Services_ term (worth a drink-of-your-choice Santi of course, next time we meet!).

I think this describes what we are after much better. Rightsizing makes much more sense than necessarily making things very small.

So here we go, with a Twitter-compatible less-than-140-characters definition:

> Federated Services are independently deployable, scalable and swarm-friendly software components with language agnostic interfaces.

That's it. I don't think we need more than that to define those services.

WDYT?

(\*) I'm working on a blog post about some elements the history of service oriented systems with another good Apache Friend. Stay tuned!
