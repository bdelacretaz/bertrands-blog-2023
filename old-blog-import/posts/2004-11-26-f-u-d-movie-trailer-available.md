Michi Ramsay's F U D movie trailer (Wyona Pictures) is available online thanks to [chregu](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/f-u-d-trailer-available.html) and [Andreas](http://delicate.ch/). It's beautiful, with lots of energy. have a look!

Michi's movie is about open source, based (AFAIK, haven't seen much of it) on interviews of people involved in it. He did interview me at OSCOM 4, along with much more famous people. And I hear there will be nice [desert shots](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/f-u-d-co-starring-me.html) as well.

Congratulations already, I wish Wyona Pictures all the best for the success of this project!

_(If you're around [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/) and [related projects](http://lenya.apache.org/) it'll be easy for you to find out who the mysterious Michi Ramsay is ;-)_
