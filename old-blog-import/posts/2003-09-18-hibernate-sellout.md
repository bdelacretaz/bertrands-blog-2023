The coolish Hibernate persistence framework has [joined JBoss](http://hibernate.org/136.html): Gavin King (Hibernate's main developer) has been hired by JBoss to work full-time on Hibernate (no it's not _work full-time on hibernating_ ;-)

A smaller project being helped by a larger one would usually be good news, but after the recent [bad noises](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000109.html) coming from the JBoss world, I don't know what to think.

As usual, there are many [views](http://www.freeroller.net/page/fx/20030917#gavin_is_saruman) on this ;-)
