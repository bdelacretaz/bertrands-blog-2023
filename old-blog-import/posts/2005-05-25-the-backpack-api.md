The [Backpack API](http://www.backpackit.com/api/) is a good example of the power of HTTP/XML interfaces - simple, stateless protocol, self-explanatory. We'll hear more about it, I'm sure.

O'Reilly has a [cool example](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/05/new_way_of_doin.html) with their Radar readings lists. This is _real_ web services orchestration - without the pain.
