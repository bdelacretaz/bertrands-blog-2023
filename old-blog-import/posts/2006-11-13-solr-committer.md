Thanks to the [Solr](http://incubator.apache.org/solr) team for inviting me as a [committer](http://www.mail-archive.com/solr-dev@lucene.apache.org/msg01422.html)!

Solr adds clean RESTish interfaces and strong "enterprise features" to [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/), and as such is a very useful tool to integrate search functionality in web applications. It makes the power of Lucene very easy to use (see the [tutorial](http://incubator.apache.org/solr/tutorial.html) and my [article](http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/1668) for more info).

I discovered Solr earlier this year when teaching my "web lab" class at [a local engineering school](http://www.comem.ch/), and later this year evaluated it for an important customer project, that should go online soon. You'll hear more about it!
