A journalist called me regarding a post on my french-speaking blog about [getting an eBook reader for christmas](http://codeconsult.ch/blog/2006/09/27/cher-pre-nol-pour-moi-a-sera-un-ebook/).

I guess Santa is not reading my blog - I didn't get an eBook yet. But if you've been using one for some time, said journalist would like to talk about your experience - how does that compare with reading on a laptop? Or from a dead tree book?

If you're willing to be interviewed about that, drop me a line or a comment and I'll make the necessary connections.
