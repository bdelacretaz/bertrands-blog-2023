Aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrghhh - [Open Sound World](http://osw.sourceforge.net/) looks like another sound tool that I'd like to install and play with for hours. I tried a demo of [Max/MSP](http://www.cycling74.com/products/maxmsp.html) earlier this week and I was instantly hooked - I just love playing with sound.

But I don't have time. So here's the plan: when I retire I'll reread this blog, install all this cool stuff and play with it for hours. I promise.

In the meantime...back to work ;-)
