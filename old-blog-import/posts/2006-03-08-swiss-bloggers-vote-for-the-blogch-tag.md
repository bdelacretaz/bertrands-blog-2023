[Stephanie](http://climbtothestars.org/) suggests using the [blogch Technorati tag](http://technorati.com/tag/blogch) to mark posts related to the _Swiss blogosphere_ (whatever that is ;-)

If you like the idea, please post a comment on [her post](http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2006/03/07/vous-parlez-de-la-blogosphere-suisse) (in French) to vote for it!

Me, I also liked _blogospherahelvetica_ a lot, but people find it longish.

Should we also add tags to indicate the post language, like _french_, _english_ or _schwyzterduetsch_? I think so.
