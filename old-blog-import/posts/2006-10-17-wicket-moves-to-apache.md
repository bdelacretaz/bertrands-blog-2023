The [Wicket](http://wicket.sourceforge.net/) project has moved to the [Apache Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/wicket), and given that it already fulfills many criteria for exiting incubation, everybody hopes to see it graduate soon.

More info in the [official announcement](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-wicket-dev/200610.mbox/%3c918312fe0610150906g10be8634o3ef24e6b91994706@mail.gmail.com%3e).

I have signed up as mentor to help with the incubation - although I do not use Wicket currently, it's been on my radar for a while and I'm looking for an opportunity to try it on a real project.

Wicket's philosophy (to put it simply) is to do everything in the Java space, taking advantage of the language's full power. This makes it a nice tool for people who are proficient in Java and don't need the "easier stuff" that other frameworks provide, which sometimes gets in the way.
