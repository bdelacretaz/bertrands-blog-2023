I'll have to move my server soon, can anyone recommend a good virtual server or root server provider? I've been looking at [greatnet](http://www.greatnet.de) and [netclusive](http://www.netclusive.de/), and from their prices I might go for a hardware server.

They both offer good Debian root servers, but greatnet's own web server seems reliably faster than netclusive, they might have better connectivity from here. [Webhostlists.de](http://webhostlist.de/)'s connectivity statistics confirm this.
