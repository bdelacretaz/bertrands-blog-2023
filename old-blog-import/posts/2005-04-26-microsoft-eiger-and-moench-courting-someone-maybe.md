Many [news sites](http://www.google.ch/search?q=microsoft+eiger+&hl=en&lr=&start=0&sa=N) are reporting on Microsoft developing two "Server Centric Computing Clients" codenamed _Eiger_ and _Moench_.

As my government is one of the few around here who has not made much committment to non-Microsoft software, I can't help making mental connections here: _Eiger_ and _Moench_ are two well-known [Swiss mountains](http://www.about.ch/cantons/bern/eiger_moench_jungfrau.html), well visible from [our Parliament's](http://www.parlament.ch/e/homepage.htm) terrace.

Who could resist having computers named after two big pieces of our national heritage all around the place?

Let's hope my gov [will resist](http://www.linux.org) ;-)
