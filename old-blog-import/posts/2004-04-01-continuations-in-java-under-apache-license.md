Congratulations to [Torsten](http://vafer.org/blog/tcurdt/archives/000094.html) and [Stephan](http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=StephanMichels) for their implementation of continuations for java!

Their work is available in the Cocoon CVS as the _javaflow_ block, but my guess is that it could be of interest to [other projects](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) as well.

If you want to know what continuations are and what they're used for, have a look a the [Cocoon Flow](http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=WhatIsFlow) documentation.

_Update: although this might sound too good to be true it is **not** an April's fools joke, you can actually [check it out](http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/cocoon-2.1/src/blocks/javaflow/java/org/apache/cocoon/components/flow/java/)!_
