Interesting [list](http://www.hibernate.org/38.html) of project success factors over at the [hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org) site.

I'll summarize the points here so that I (we?) can make a mental picture:

rapid release schedule  
regression tests  
do one thing well  
avoid over-design  
a central vision  
documentation  
avoid standardsism  
up and running in ten minutes or less!  
developer responsiveness  
easily update-able wiki pages.....

All this resonates loudly here. Next job is to minimize the gap between theory and practice (not talking about Hibernate, they're doing fine I think).
