Another [scary report](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/10/03/outlookNotSoGood) of serious damage caused by the web's main _virus pump_.

If you're using Outlook for mail, my suggestion would be that you throw it away as soon as possible. There are [enough](http://www.eudora.com/) decent [alternatives](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/).

(You might want to throw away Windows while you're at it, but that's [another](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) [story](http://www.linux.org/) ;-)
