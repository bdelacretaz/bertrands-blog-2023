With (too) many projects competing for my time currently, I find myself spending a lot of time in [bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/) to coordinate people and keep them busy (as in _doing useful work_, not _reinventing hot air_).

It works real good - as always, the power of loosely-coupled communities or teams is amazing if they're well coordinated.

[This paper](http://www.python.org/dev/dev_intro.html) explains how the Python community is organized. I have to read it to steal some ideas find out how they do it.
