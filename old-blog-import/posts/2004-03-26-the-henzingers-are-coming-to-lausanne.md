A while ago I noticed that Google's [Monika Henzinger](http://www.henzinger.com/monika/) was giving a [talk](http://ic.epfl.ch/page6879.html) at the nearby [Swiss Federal institute of Technology](http://www.epfl.ch), but didn't think about the possible implications of her visit.

Now the good news have come out (in [print](http://www.hebdo.ch/) at least - I did check, this is not April's issue): [Thomas](http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tah/) and Monika Henzinger will move here and join the institute very soon.

Lucky students! For me Google as it stands today is software at its very best: reliable, efficient and _meaningful_, the exact opposite to most of the bloatware that is floating around. So having the (now former I assume) Director of Research at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) is really good news for the future of computing around here.

(hey notice I'm in a good mood: I didn't make _bloatware_ a link ;-)

_Update: official [news](http://actualites.epfl.ch/index.php?module=Presseinfo&func=display_com&id=148&return_func=view_com&year=2004) are available (use the E-Henzinger link on that page for an english PDF)_
