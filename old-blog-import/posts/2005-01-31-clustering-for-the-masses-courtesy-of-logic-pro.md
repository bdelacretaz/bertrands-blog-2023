With so much networked CPU power available in many homes and most offices today, it's not hard to predict that clustering computers will become mainstream soon.

Apple's [Logic Pro](http://www.apple.com/logic/) digital audio production software shows the way by making it easy to combine several networked macosx systems into an [audio processing and synthesis cluster](http://www.apple.com/logic/distributedaudio.html). They do recommend Gigabit Ethernet for clustering more than two computers, but it looks very easy and affordable to setup.

So, order your stack of [Mac Mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini/) today and start making beautiful music!
