Exploring trackback... Steven, I hope you won't mind me [tracking back](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/000679.html) to your "ping pong" article.  
[This](http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/archives/000300.html#000300) explains the Trackback mechanism well, I think. Looks like a cool way of building discussion groups on the fly. Time will tell...  

Note that that re-editing the entry later on caused pings to be sent again to the linked articles, which makes my trackbacks appear twice there. Sorry folks, I have now switched MT trackback auto-discovery off, hopefully this will not happen again.
