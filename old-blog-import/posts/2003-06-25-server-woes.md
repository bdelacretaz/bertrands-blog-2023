Looks like this server has been down since yesterday about 3PM UTC. Sorry for the inconvenience, I'm talking to [my provider](http://onsmart.com) as this is the second time in less than a month that I have to restart it for mysterious reasons.

Tom might be right about the guy [banging his head](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000056.html) against the wall, but I hope not to have to move everything once again!
