We haven't made enough noise about this up to now I guess, so here's some: [Erik](http://www.codefaktor.de/weblog/) will be hosting a great (I'm sure) workshop on apache 2 basics at LOTS on February 17th in Bern, but up to now only one person signed up.

Make it happen! The workshop might be canceled if there are not enough participants, so please [sign up](http://www.lots.ch/2005/Workshops.html?id=060) now to avoid missing it.

The workshop will be held in german but I'm sure Erik will be able to answer questions in english if you're afraid of speaking up in Goethe's language ;-)
