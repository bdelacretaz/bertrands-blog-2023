Here's my quick on-the-spot notes of [Mark O'Neill's](http://transfersummit.com/speaker/moneill) ([@marxculture](http://twitter.com/marxculture)) excellent [presentation](http://transfersummit.com/programme/1366), on how a government's IT can innovate.

Citing Andrew Savory, _never thought I'd see govt. spokesperson be entertaining and informative_. Reminds me of my excellent experiences working for the Swiss Parliament services in the late nineties.

Here's my unedited notes - slides should be [available](http://transfersummit.com/programme/1366) soon. URLs and emphasis added by myself.

> UK gov spends 20 billion pounds a year on IT, with 20 top suppliers.
> 
> Mark's got a 20MB mailbox to manage this.
> 
> Different velocities: technology, business society.
> 
> His role: track and align to those velocities.
> 
> Velocity of change in his government IT world is "very different" from what it is on the outside. The gap is increasing.
> 
> The more you diverge from the velocity of the market, the higher your costs are.
> 
> The options are: do the same, do nothing or ask a different question.
> 
> The challenge: no money - although they're spending 20 billion pounds a year...
> 
> The government is currently driven by the policy cycle: problem -> draw up a policy -> interpret and implement policy -> monitor and evaluate. The customer is not part of this picture. Need an innovation model.
> 
> He shows a picture of a washing machine for dogs: there is an e-petition about this, the e-petition site (http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/) got 16k such petitions in 4 weeks, 3.8 million visitors, 20 million page views, 1.5 million signatures. The e-petition site was built in 6 weeks with 6 people, cost 80 thousand pounds including security costs. The system will be released as open source shortly.
> 
> The future: small projects are developed by his office, up to 3 months with contracted companies, if more than 3 months need to ask different questions. 20 billion pounds a year should be one of the most dynamic, diverse and entrepreneurial market in the world. What needs to be done to achieve that?
> 
> Leaner procurement mechanisms. Use open standards and open source. Look at the processes, check how much paperwork and overhead is actually necessary. Challenge to new projects includes two questions: what is it that you want to do, and why do you want to do it that way.
> 
> Decompose the project in smaller units of work - also gives more chance for SMEs to jump in.
> 
> Three layers: infrastructure, app, support. Procurement is currently often based on a complete silo - moving to smaller units can help reuse and sharing.
> 
> Rethink the approach to make it possible to buy an excellent application form an SME that does not provide infrastructure or services.
> 
> Working on G-Cloud, private onshore cloud for UK government services. (http://www.cloudbook.net/directories/gov-clouds/uk-government-cio-council).
> 
> Talking of "agile" "cloud" is a bit like talking about "magic" these days ;-)
> 
> **Conversation always trumps process**.
> 
> Two key differences between agile and waterfall.
> 
> First difference: with waterfall you talk to developers, they go away for six months, come back with something that you don't want. Agile: you talk all the time.
> 
> Second difference: with waterfall, you might not be around anymore when problems arise. With agile, you could be fired after three months...
> 
> Tools are hard. Discuss, share, build, learn. Cannot deliver success without using efficient tools, take example from open development teams in the outside world.
> 
> Need to build mechanisms to learn, share and discuss what the team is doing.
> 
> Success factors:
> 
> 1) Be the most dynamic, diverse and entrepreneurial market in the world.
> 
> 2) IT should just work.
> 
> 3) Reuse, dialogue, agility, ownership should be part of the day-to-day business.
