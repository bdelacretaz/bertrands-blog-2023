Way too many deadlines forced me to give up on attending [lift06](http://www.lift06.org/), and from what I hear I really missed something.

I've just looked at small excerpts for now, but the [videos](http://www.freestudios.tv/?cdroite=tablo_lift06) with synchronized slides look really useful.

If you missed it as well, here are some links which will help you get a feel for what we missed:

- The [shoes off](http://www.flickr.com/photos/35034363287@N01/95437797/) attitude.

Congratulations to the lift06 [team](http://www.lift06.org/doku.php/people:organizers) - it seems like everyone's happy about the conference!
