Videos of some Google Tech Talks are available...guess where? at [Google Video](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Google+techtalks).

Via [Ovidiu](http://www.webweavertech.com/ovidiu/weblog/archives/000442.html) - the man who first told me about [Cocoon Flow](http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/flow/index.html)!

_Update: funny, [Sylvain](http://bluxte.net/blog/2006-02/03-27-18.html) says he cannot play the videos from his .fr location, but from my .ch it works fine. Probably something to do with the French Connection acting up..._
