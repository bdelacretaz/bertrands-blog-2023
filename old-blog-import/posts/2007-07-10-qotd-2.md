The Quote Of The Day is by an inspired (as usual) [Gianugo](http://www.rabellino.it/blog/2007/07/09/french-cheese-and-open-source/):

> Open Source is a German car, an Italian shoe or a mold of French cheese. In most cases Open Source can be the best solution, just as expected.

Although one must keep in mind that:

> French cheese is usually a godsend, but sometimes it can be just some stinky rotten milk.

Very True (except I don't really like cheese, but that's another story).
