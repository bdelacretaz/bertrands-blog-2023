Tried [WW2D](http://ww2d.berlios.de) yesterday evening (via [Urs](http://www.circle.ch/blog/p1780.html)) - it's the first time a Java client program feels that good, the scrolling and fluid movements are really well done.

I haven't installed any add-ons yet, so the additional data (place names etc.) is rather scarce. Gotta need some more Copious Free Time to play with this...
