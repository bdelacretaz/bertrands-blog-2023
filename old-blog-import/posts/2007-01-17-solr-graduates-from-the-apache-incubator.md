Here's the announcement, fresh from my inbox:

It will take a few days until all the related websites are updated, but the vote at the [incubator](http://incubator.apache.org) has passed.

As Yonik puts it, it seems like [Solr](http://incubator.apache.org/solr/) is just getting started.

Have a look at the [mailing list stats](http://people.apache.org/~coar/mlists.html) below, this looks promising.

The solr-dev list is first, the solr-users. In blue the number of subscribers, in red the number of posts per day.

Congratulations to everyone involved in making this happen, I guess we'll have a beer at [ApacheCon EU 07](http://www.apachecon.com/2007/EU/)!
