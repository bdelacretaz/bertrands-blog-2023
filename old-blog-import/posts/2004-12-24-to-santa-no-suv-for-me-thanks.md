As Europe slowly but surely picks up on the SUV rage (or 4x4 as we like to call them here), Malcolm Gladwell's [Big and Bad](http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_01_12_a_suv.html) article gives insight into what these vehicles actually are and what they often mean to people. It could be a bit funny, but when you think about the environmental and safety consequences it's not.

Me, I loved driving a big four-wheel drive around [Weipa](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000353.html) last summer, and we _really_ needed it there. But, driving one alone in your suit in the city? Come on, let's be a bit [smarter](http://www.smart.com). Or ride a bike.
