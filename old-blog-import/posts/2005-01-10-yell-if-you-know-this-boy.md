![](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/tsunami-boy.jpg)This poor guy is said to be stranded in a Phuket hospital without his parents, and the people there don't even know where he comes from (I assume because he doesn't speak - one should recognize the language otherwise).

_(I have removed the contact information, see the update below)_

I hope it's not a hoax, didn't do a million checks though, let's hope for the best.

_Update: looks like Hannes has been [reunited with his father](http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/children/hannes.asp) since a few days already. For once I was too quick to react;-)_
