Simon Phipps [notes](http://www.webmink.net/2003_12_07_oldblog.htm#107090600088250120) several news items about governments or large companies switching to (or about to switch to) Sun's [Java Desktop](http://wwws.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/).

If Sun becomes a major player with this software (and I hope they do), it will be interesting to see how they handle this success - will they milk their customers to no end once they're established? I hope not, and I think Sun sees value in honesty and fairness, but in today's world it's a hard guess.

I'm firmly convinced that being loyal to your customers is the best long-term strategy, and I don't think this is the strategy of Microsoft currently (notice I'm being fairly politically correct here). Let's hope someone changes this _soon_.
