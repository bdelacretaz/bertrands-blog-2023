Wow. If you haven't tried [LogFactor5](http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/lf5/features.html) and you use some logging in your apps, your should have a look at it! It can be enabled real easy in Cocoon 2.1 by editing cocoon.xconf, see comments inside that file.

What? your apps don't use logging? you can sign them up for the museum-of-lost-apps then, opening soon ;-)
