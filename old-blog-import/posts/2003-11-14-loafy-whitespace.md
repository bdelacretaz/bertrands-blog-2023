[Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/archives/000080.html) jumps on the LOAF bandwagon with a clever [XSLT](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/archives/loaf.xslt) implementation. We told you there was a trend here.

Thinking about it, the best language to write a [LOAF](http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~pvg/loaf.txt) subsystem is without doubt our old friend [Whitespace](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000027.html).

So, here you go, here's my Whitespace [implementation](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/files/loaf.ws). I don't see how there could be any [interoperability](http://www.silent-penguin.com/loaf/loafinterop.html) problems, I wrote it while many of my brain cells were active and it is _right_.
