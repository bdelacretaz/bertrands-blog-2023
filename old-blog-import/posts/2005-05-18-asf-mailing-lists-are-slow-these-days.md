Seems like the ASF mailing lists are unsually slow, messages take a few hours to go through instead of a few seconds as usual. The mail servers are most probably busy /dev/nulling _some_ Sober virus mails.

Maybe it's really time for an Internet user driver's license. Or, as someone suggested, kick all Windows users from the net until they can demonstrate that they know how to setup their antivirus properly ;-)
