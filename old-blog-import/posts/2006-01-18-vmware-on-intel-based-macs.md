Seems like it shouldn't be too hard for VMWare to run on Intel-based Macs. They already have Windows and Linux versions, so it's safe to assume that they know how to port their stuff.

[Ask Bjoern Hansen](http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2006/01/17/vmware_on_os_x.html) has written them to enquire and reading between the lines of their reply seems to indicate that yes, they're going to do it.

Hmm...a fast Windows safely tucked in a sandbox on MacOSX would sure be attractive for many Mac users. I'll stay tuned.

And by the way, there's no reason why [QEMU](http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/) should not come to Intel-based MacOSX as well, they're running most everywhere already.
