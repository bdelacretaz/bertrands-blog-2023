The main G8-related demonstrations [went ok](http://swissinfo.ch/sen/swissinfo.html?siteSect=105&sid=3894151) in Geneva and Lausanne this week-end.

But - out of 30'000 demonstrators (figures vary depending on who you ask), even a small percentage of idiots is enough to cause a [lot](http://www.diapo.ch/galerie.php/62) of [trouble](http://www.tdg.ch/accueil/geneve_en_photos/photo/index.php?Page_ID=13158).

This was more or less expected, but for me the most troubling report is that the hooligans of last night were apparently followed by about 5000 lurkers wanting to see the show - and steal stuff from broken store windows. Come on guys, if you want to be part of the action, join the police. Or let them do their job.

And by the way, well-organized event: have the meeting in some unknown town near your border and let the next-door country have the idiots in more well-known cities...
