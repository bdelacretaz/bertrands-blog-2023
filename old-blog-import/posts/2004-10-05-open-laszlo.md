Wow - the Flash user interfaces generated by [Open Laszlo](http://www.openlaszlo.org) are just plain gorgeous. Have a look at the [demos](http://www.laszlosystems.com/demos/).

The Laszlo Presentation Server compiles XML descriptions of user interfaces to Flash 5- a really nice way to build rich user interfaces on the web.

Man...I need some more of these 58-hour days to test all the great stuff that is floating around ;-)

Update: I shouldn't forget to mention [David Temkin's words](http://www.davidtemkin.com/mtarchive/000006.html) on why Laszlo became open source: _The world has changed, and we've taken notice_. Many others would be well inspired to take notice ;-)

_Update #2: the first person to write a Cocoon serializer and samples for Laszlo gets a very large glass of their favorite drink (but don't tell me you like to drink melted gold ;-)_

_Update #3: [Vadim](http://blog.reverycodes.com/archives/000032.html) is running for the bounty!_
