Knowing my interest for group collaboration tools, [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/) recently pointed me to [OpenGroupware.org](http://opengroupware.org/).

After studying their docs I'm very impressed by the software - it seems like it would cover most non-code project management needs and could nicely complement my [usual set of tools](http://orixo.com/events/gt2003/sessions.html#bertrand).

OpenGroupware also provides an XML-RPC interface (so they say - I haven't tested anything), which could be very useful in integrating such a tool with custom workflow or editing tools.

Thanks Sylvain! I'll keep this in mind.
