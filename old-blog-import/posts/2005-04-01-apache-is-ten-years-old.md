This has been in my "must post about this" list for a while so I missed the exact date: 10 years ago the Apache Group started its online life. Read more [here](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=110954136531190&w=2).

The [mail archives](http://mail-archives.eu.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/199503.mbox/index.html) are still around if you want to go back in time. Historians, help yourselves!
