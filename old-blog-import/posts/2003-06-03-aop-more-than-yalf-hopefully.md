Most aspect-oriented programming examples I've seen show some form of logging being added to objects through AOP.

Fine. I wouldn't add Yet Another Logging Framework to my projects though, [log4j](http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/) is good enough.

In [this short article](http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/05/30/22OPstrategic_1.html), Jon Udell shows another "aspect" of AOP that opens wider perspectives: using AOP to add _persistence_ to objects. Sounds much more interesting than YALF.
