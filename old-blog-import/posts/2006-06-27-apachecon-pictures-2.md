[![apachecon-hackathon.jpg](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/apachecon-hackathon.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/apachecon2006/)The [conference](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/) starts with two days of [Hackathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon). Meeting the folks IRL is a pleasure, as always!

Pictures can be found on Flickr under the [apachecon2006/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/apachecon2006/) tag.

_Update: some people have also been using the [apacheconeu2006](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/apacheconeu2006/) and [apachecon](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/apachecon/) tags. The good thing about standards...I'm going to use all three from now now._
