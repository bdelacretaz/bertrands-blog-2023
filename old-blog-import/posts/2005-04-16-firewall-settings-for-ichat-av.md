[Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/), who helped my find a good excuse to buy an ISight camera, explains the firewall settings required to use IChat AV.

The excuse is that he agreed to be interviewed by my [students](http://www.comem.ch) in a videoconference during their _XML lab_ course. We'll do that next week, looking forward to it! I hope the students find interesting questions to ask, I have to make sure they think about if beforehand...
