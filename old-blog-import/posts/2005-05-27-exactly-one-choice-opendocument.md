[Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/05/26/OpenDocument):

> ...if you occasionally create documents or spreadsheets or presentations, and if you think that youâ€™d like to own them, independent of your Office software vendor, well, you have exactly one choice: [OpenDocument](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office)...

The OpenDocument v1.0 format was approved a few days ago by OASIS, and its schema is published in [RelaxNG](http://www.relaxng.org/).

Tim also says that they're committed to making OpenDocument an ISO standard, which should make a significant difference for its acceptance in Europe.

Looks like something to stay tuned to!
