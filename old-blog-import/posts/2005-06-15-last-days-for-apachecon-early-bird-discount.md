[![ac2005eu_135x50.gif](images/ac2005eu_135x50.gif)](http://apachecon.com/2005/EU)To take advantage of the early bird discount for [ApacheCon 2005](http://apachecon.com/2005/EU/) in Stuttgart (18-22 July), you must register before June 17th, which is Real Soon Now. So hurry if you're planning to be there (and you should - the program looks great).

It's going to be my first ApacheCon, looking forward to it. My talks haven't been accepted, but I'll try again next time!
