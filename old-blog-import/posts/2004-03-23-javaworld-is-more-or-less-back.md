I didn't notice that [JavaWorld](http://www.javaworld.com/) was away but they're back with weblogs.

Small "detail" though, they don't seem to have RSS feeds for their weblogs or articles. I have politely [asked](http://www.javaworld.com/javaforums/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=weblogs&Number=5639&page=0&view=collapsed) but I'm not too optimistic given the "we want you to see these ADS first" feel of their front page.

_Update: turns out there is a [feed](http://www.javaworld.com/index.xml), but it seems to deliver stuff from infoworld at large. Better than nothing._
