Family experiments...

- Doggy gets offspring Real Soon Now. We'll see how fun it is, I never have experienced this in my life, they say we might have between two and twelve puppies...
- I have setup a new blog (in French) for [chienchien](http://chienchien.bestiole.ch). Trying to talk the kids (ages 11 to 15) into writing their own accounts of what's happening. It will be interesting to see if they make use of it or not!
