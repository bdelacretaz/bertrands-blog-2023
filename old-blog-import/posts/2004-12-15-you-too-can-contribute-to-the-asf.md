As the end (of the year) is near (aaaaaarghhhhhhh it went so fast once again) it's a good time to remind everybody here that you too _can_ contribute to the Apache Software Foundation - there are [many ways](http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html) to do it: join a project, make a donation (money, equipment even your old car if you're in the United States), buy stuff, etc.

Do you use ASF software? Do you like it?

You _can_ vote with your skills or your wallet, thanks!
