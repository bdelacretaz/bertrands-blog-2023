With [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/) it's easy to be connected to all sorts of IM systems, and I had this old [AIM](http://www.aim.com/) account that I almost never used.

Lately it's been telling me regularly that I'm connected from two places simultaneously, when moving from the laptop to the office beasty. Annoying, and given the (non-)utility of it, not worth investigating.

So I have disabled this account. If this was the only channel that you used to talk to me: I'm not dead (not yet at least), you'll just need to use another of these fine (balkanized) IM services.
