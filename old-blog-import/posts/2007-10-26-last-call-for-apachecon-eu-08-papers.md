[![apachecon-logo.png](images/apachecon-logo.png)](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/)The deadline is _today_ and the URL is [http://www.eu.apachecon.com/](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/).

I'm submitting a talk on [microsling](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000808.html) (together with my colleague Felix from the Felix project), my usual [XSLT](http://www.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz) stuff (mostly a rerun), something new on Open Source collaboration tools, and a tentative _OSGi services made easy_ talk to demonstrate the cool [Maven plugins](http://felix.apache.org/site/maven-scr-plugin.html) provided by [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org/).

_Update: the deadline has been extended to November 2nd._
