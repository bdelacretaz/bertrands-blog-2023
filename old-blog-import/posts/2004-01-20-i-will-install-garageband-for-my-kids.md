Despite Steven's [warning](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/001683.html), I _will_ buy and install GarageBand - for my kids (well that's the official version at least ;-).

It's musical around here: my son (12) plays electric guitar, the younger daughter (13 1/2) plays piano and the older one (15 1/2) also plays piano _and_ starts electric guitar tomorrow (no kidding).

They're all fairly comfortable with computers and I'm eager to hear what they will do with what seems to be a powerful and easy to use tool.

Stay tuned!
