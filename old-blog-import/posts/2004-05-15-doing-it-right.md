[Lauren Wood](http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/index.php?p=20) mentions four things that [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) is doing right.

Food for tought (but read the full article, it's worth it!): let me summarize the points to make a mental picture like [last week](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000310.html):

- It’s easy to find out what the software does
- It does what it claims to do
- It looks like people still work on it
- There’s some hope of getting help with problems

Sounds Very Right.
