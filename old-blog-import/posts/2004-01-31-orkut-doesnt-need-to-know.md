Following recent discussions about the use of [orkut](http://www.orkut.com) and similar networks, I have removed from it all the information that is not relevant to my business activities.

I'm still interested in the experiment, but I don't think any personal information is relevant to it (mostly because I'm only interested in this for business and/or Open-Source networking).

Okay, I have finally re-added "friends" to my interests. But just having an Orkut link to someone will not make us "friends" unless something has happened elsewhere.

There's a delicate balance to find between "virtual" and "real" friends - I have friends of both kinds, and it's great, but I'm still learning...too many tools, too many options...
