Just found out that del.icio.us [automatically tags](http://del.icio.us/help/mediafiletypes) certain file extensions with tags like _system:media:audio_ and generates RSS feeds with enclosures (like [http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/system:media:audio](http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/system:media:audio)).

Combined with an RSS-aware media player like [DTV](http://dtvmac.com/), this makes for a cheap way to create your own TV channel.

One of my current projects requires similar technology - this will be useful for testing, at least.
