I hope to make it to Martin Odersky's [The Scala Experience](http://www.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/memento/memento/view/pretty/submem=IC?entry=C405687015) talk, next Monday at EPFL Lausanne.

_Update: very interesting as expected, we got a quick but extensive tour of Scala's main features. The slides at [lamp.eplf.ch](http://lamp.epfl.ch/~odersky/talks/pppj07.pdf) are the same that he used for the talk, as far as I can tell, but the offline version won't be as good as listening to Mr.Scala himself, obviously._
