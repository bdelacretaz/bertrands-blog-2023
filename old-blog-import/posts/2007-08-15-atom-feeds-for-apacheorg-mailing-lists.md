To keep in touch with all things Apache, feel free to subscribe to the Atom feeds provided by the [ASF mail archives](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/).

See [http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod\_mbox/www-announce/](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/) for example, the Atom link near the top of the page allows you to follow the main announce@apache.org as a news feed.

Thanks Justin for pointing this out!
