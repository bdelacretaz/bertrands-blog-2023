LOTS committee member [Matthias Stuermer](http://stuermer.ch/) has just published his [dissertation](http://stuermer.ch/Licenciate.html) on Open Source Community building, including interviews from members of the Plone, Magnolia, Cocoon (that's me), Kupu, Lenya, TYPO3, eZ publish and Xaraya communities. The website is mostly in german but the document is in english.

I haven't read all the 153 pages yet, but I'm looking forward to reading all the interviews and see what others think. I'll try to draw my own conclusions and see if they match his analysis.

My interview "sounds" a bit different to what I remember, as it has been translated from german to english. It's probably the case for some of the others as well. Traduttore...you know what they [say](http://www.multilingualwebmaster.com/library/puns_translation.html) ;-)

It has been a big work I think - congratulations Matthias!
