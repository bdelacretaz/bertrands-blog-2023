![carsten-ziegeler-on-portals.jpg](images/carsten-ziegeler-on-portals.jpg)Carsten is making the news on this weblog these days! I'm sitting in his packed _One Hour Portal_ session.

Memorable quotes:

- All portal systems will provide 80% of what you need, it's the remaining 20% that you should be worrying about.
- Cocoon is always the best solution (I think this one was tongue-in-cheek ;-)
- In a recent poll done by Carten's company, they found out that their customers don't care much about portal standards - for them the important point is the _integration_ of data and applications.

The Cocoon portal started in September 2000, so this is mature technology!

Carsten's session is a really good overview of Cocoon, you shouldn't miss it if he does it again somewhere else.

_Update: Sylvain has a [picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/66426592@N00/27521532/) of the packed house. Seems like Ugo's session which was next was also packed, congratulations guys!_
