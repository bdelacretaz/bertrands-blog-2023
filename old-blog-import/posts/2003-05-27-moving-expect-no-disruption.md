I'm finally moving all of codeconsult.ch to my new server at [onsmart](http://onsmart.net).

I have configured the old server as a reverse proxy for the new one, so this should be transparent for all you (three) readers. We'll see, but please bear with me if service is not 100% here in the next few days.

_Update: "expect no disruption" - you didn't believe me, did you? There have been connectivity problems between my old server (UK) and the new one (US), so it's not as smooth as I expected it. I'm doing the DNS change tonight to go back to direct connections._
