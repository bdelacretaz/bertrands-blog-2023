Lots of stuff from [Matthew](http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001354.html), [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/001186.html), [Marcus](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/crafterm/archives/001184.html), [Marc](http://radio.weblogs.com/0116284/2003/10/07.html#a143), [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/archives/000074.html), [Michael](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/michaelm/archives/001183.html) and I have probably forgotten someone.

Talk reports are available on the [Cocoon Wiki](http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=GetTogether2003Notes).

_Update: more pictures from [Steven](http://outerthought.net/~stevenn/GT2003Impressions.html), and forgot to link to [Marcus's](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/crafterm/archives/001187.html) beautiful views of Ghent (yes, there was an "outside" too ;-)_
