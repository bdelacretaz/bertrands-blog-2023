[Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](http://poignantguide.net/ruby/) had me ROTFL. Just look at the [Holy, where's my legs](http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-3.html) cartoon.

The "book" is a beautiful example of CSS design.

This kind of humor reminds me of [Les Shadoks](http://www.lesshadoks.com/) (in french, and rather a counter-example for design ;-)
