Yesterday I received an email apparently from Stefano, most probably forged as it seems to contain a virus (and Stefano is [having fun offline](http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/16/) anyway, lucky him).

I also got another "message rejected" reply indicating my @apache.org address as the sender, but I didn't send this message. Looks like someone is playing with @apache.org addresses, I don't think there's much that can be done about it technically.

_Update: on the community@ list, someone mentions the [Klez](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.h@mm.html) worm as a possible cause (see "email spoofing" down that page). Sounds like someone with @apache.org addresses in their address book has been infected by this. Long live Outlook ;-)_
