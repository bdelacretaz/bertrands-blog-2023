[CVSreport](http://www.nongnu.org/cvsreport/) generates cool HTML reports of CVS activity, including the ability to report on _changesets_ as a whole. Won't be able to try it now but it looks interesting.

Via [Andreas Hochsteger](http://highstick.blogspot.com/2003_11_01_highstick_archive.html#106876376972318414). Funny, his weblog does not seem to be LOAF-compliant yet.
