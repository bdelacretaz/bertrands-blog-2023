I've been getting at least one, if not several invitations for new social networks every day lately.

So, please don't feel offended if I ignore them, it is sometimes hard to select between timewasters and...more timewasters ;-)

(seriously: some of this stuff is _very_ useful, but as with any new tool it looks like we're in the _explosion of new offerings_ phase right now).
