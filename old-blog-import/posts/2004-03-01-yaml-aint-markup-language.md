[YAML](http://www.yaml.org) looks like a very good [structured text format](http://www.yaml.org/start.html), easily readable and writable by humans as well as machines. The [spec](http://www.yaml.org/spec/) looks good.

Ruby 1.8.0 is reported to have [built-in support](http://yaml4r.sourceforge.net/) for YAML.

Via [J Aaron Farr](http://www.jadetower.org/muses/archives/000028.html).

_Update: I should have mentioned [OGDL](http://ogdl.sourceforge.net/) which is similar, but meant for the representation of general graphs more than documents._
