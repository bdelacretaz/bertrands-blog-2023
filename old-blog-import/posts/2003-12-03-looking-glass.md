Sun's [Looking Glass](http://wwws.sun.com/software/looking_glass/demo.html) demo looks cool (the interesting part starts about 2:30 into the video).

I'm not sure about showing today's windows in 3D perspective, but this certainly opens the door to new types of navigation.

_Update: a better [demo](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/xtreme/) is available._
