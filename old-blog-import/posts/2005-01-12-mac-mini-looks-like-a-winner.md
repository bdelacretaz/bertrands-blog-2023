![](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/mac-mini.jpg)Doesn't it?. [This](http://www.apple.com/macmini/) should help many people with aging (or even virus infected) boxes make a decision to switch.

The specs look strangely like my powerbook's, the performance should be more than decent for day-to-day work or play.

It's not hard to bet that Apple will sell as many of these as they can make. And we'll see clones sooner than later, at least at the visual design level. Bye bye big and empty PC boxes!
