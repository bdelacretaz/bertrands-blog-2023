Via [Pier](http://www.betaversion.org/~pier/2005/10/new-java-for-mac-os-x.html): Apple have just made their _J2SE 5.0 Release 3 Developer Preview 2_ available on their [Apple Developer Connection](http://developer.apple.com/) website.

I haven't tried it yet, and I hope it installs on Panther which I'm still running due to the Checkpoint VPN client which [still not running](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000517.html) under Tiger (and Checkpoint have not replied to my request for information about what to expect when).
