Yesterday Brussels Airport Security wouldn't let me bring my [Cybertool](http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/swissarmy-cybertool-review.html) on board. Forgot to put it in my luggage at check-in, it was in my backpack just in case. _booh-hoooh..._

So I'm now the proud owner of a paper which I can bring to an office there to get it back. Anyone need a day of Cocoon consulting in Brussels so I can go back and get it?

_Update: thanks to [Tom](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/tomk/) I got my knife back. Weblogs are great! Virtual friends are great!_
