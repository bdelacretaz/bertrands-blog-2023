Well, it wasn't hard but on the day Gmail was born [I predicted it](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000283.html) (among...hmmm..other not-so-precog statements). A free online gigabyte obviously triggers some nice ideas.

Today, [GmailFS](http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html) (via [Urs](http://www.circle.ch/blog/p1510.html)) and [Gallina](http://ion.gluch.org.mx/files/Hacks/gallina/), a Gmail-backed weblog, make the vision come true.
