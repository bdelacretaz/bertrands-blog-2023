Warning: this post will most probably eat your next half hour...

You _have_ to run and have a look at the [ApacheCon US 2005 photos](http://www.humancreativity.com/view/apachecon/) by Julian Cash!

His _edible light_ shots are incredible...and if you're around the ASF you'll recognize many familiar faces. [Torsten](http://www.humancreativity.com/view/apachecon/edible1/medium_apcn_01_0273a_bjp.html) - what did you drink?

_Update: yes, it's ApacheCon **US** indeed - title changed. What did I drink?_
