(I promise - next week we'll have some really serious blogging here, about serious work-related things ;-)

As someone says, [this guy](http://www.guitar-gear.com/news/shownews.php?newsid=1627) might need an industrial designer to make the thing look better, but I find the [video](http://trio.harmony-central.com/ramgen/SNAMM04/Keytar.rm) very convincing. The Keytar looks easy and fun to play - I'd love to try one!
