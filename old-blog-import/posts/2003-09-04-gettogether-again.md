The registration for the [Cocoon GetTogether 2003](http://orixo.com/events/gt2003/) is now open, reserve your seat while there is some space left!

Actually according to [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/001116.html) the venue is large enough to accomodate many more people than last year. It is good to see this event growing.

The GT team has accepted my proposal to [talk](http://orixo.com/events/gt2003/program.html) about the project management tools that we use for Cocoon. After the interesting discussions that we had about [PowerPoint](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000076.html) recently, I will have to follow Tufte's advice and come up with a presentation that includes actual _content_, not just nice packaging. There's plenty enough to be said though, it's mainly a matter of concentrating on the essential stuff I guess.

By the way, there's more on PowerPoint in this month's Wired magazine. Haven't read it all yet, but apparently the views are widely varying.
