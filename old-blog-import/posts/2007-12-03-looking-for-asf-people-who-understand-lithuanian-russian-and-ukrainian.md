As part of [GHOP](http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/), a student is preparing a presentation of the ASF in Lithuanian.

If you're a member of the ASF community (at large) and understand this language, you're welcome to join the fun and help us review the student's presentation and give advice on the content. It's a small thing, you probably won't need more than 15 to 30 minutes to do that!

See the [ASF GHOP issue tracker, issue 45](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-asf/issues/detail?id=45) and the [ASF presentations discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/asf-ghop-presentation) for more info.

There's a similar request to review a presentation in Russian or Ukrainian, that's [Issue 43](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-asf/issues/detail?id=43).
