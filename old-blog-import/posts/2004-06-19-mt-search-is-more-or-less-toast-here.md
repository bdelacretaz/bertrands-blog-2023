For some reason the search function on this weblog does not work properly anymore: searching for "mozilla", for example, finds this entry, but not the [other one from way back](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000009.html). I've checked the _SearchCutoff_ parameter and I'm using the default value which should search everything.

If anyone has tips on how to fix this please let me know!

I'm thinking of a database rebuild, but haven't found any tools (I'm using the standard Berkeley DB). Maybe an export/reimport of the entries would do, but will it keep the entries IDs?

I won't be too adventurous before the big trip though, but if there's a simple fix I'd be interested.
