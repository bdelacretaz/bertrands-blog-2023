Several participants to the recent ASF Infrathon, where Apache Software Foundation people gathered to work on infrastructure servers, have been [interviewed](http://madpenguin.org/cms/?m=show&id=3847) by Christian Einfeldt of Mad Penguin. Well worth a read, and it's been [mentioned on slashdot](http://apache.slashdot.org/apache/05/04/05/1951228.shtml?tid=166&tid=2&tid=106) as well.

Big big thanks to the Infrathon team for their work - you guys play a critical role in allowing many people to _stand on the shoulders of giants_.
