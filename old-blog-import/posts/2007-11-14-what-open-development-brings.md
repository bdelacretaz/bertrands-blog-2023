I think [Gianugo](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000821.html) is very right here.

Open Source brings you only:

- Null or very low acquisition costs
- Easier license management

But [Open Development](http://www.open-development.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Main/WebHome) brings you, in addition to that:

- Peer review, which leads to higher quality
- Reduced vendor lock-in
- Shared R&D costs

That makes all the difference.
