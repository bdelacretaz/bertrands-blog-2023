Big thanks to [Colm MacCÃ¡rthaigh](http://www.stdlib.net/~colmmacc/2006/06/27/apachecon-days-1-of-2-and-more/) (I cheated - did a copy/past from his blog to get the accents right) who spent most of his time in the last days to setup the connectivity [here](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/).

The network works great, even though it must get some beating, as there are many people with open laptops all around.
