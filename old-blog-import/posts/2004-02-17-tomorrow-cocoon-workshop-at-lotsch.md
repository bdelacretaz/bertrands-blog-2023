There's still space for more participants at my [workshop](http://lots.ch/Supersonic_Tour_of_Apache_Cocoon.html) tomorrow at [lots.ch](http://lots.ch/).

As the _Supersonic Tour_ name implies, we won't go deep into any part of Cocoon, but rather give an overview of the Pipelines, Flow, and Forms stuff (please don't look for a suitable [acronym](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=107635144932215&w=2) ;-), with lots of practical examples, to help people get the big picture of Cocoon as it stands today.

The [event](http://lots.ch/Programm.html) looks yummy with talks on many different subjects (most of it in German though).

_Update: the workshop went very well, I think showing just the Power Trio (Pipelines, Flow and Forms) hit the target. It was a lot of work to prepare, though, hopefully I'll be able to do it again somewhere else!_
