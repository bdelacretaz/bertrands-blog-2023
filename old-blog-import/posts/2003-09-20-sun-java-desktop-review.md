Although I'm [not sure](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000129.html) about the name, according to [this review](http://newsforge.com/newsforge/03/09/18/003212.shtml?tid=23) Sun has indeed created a very usable Linux distribution for office workers.

This is great news - technically I'm convinced that Linux is ready for general office work today, and it's good to see more and more pieces of the puzzle falling into place.
