Sylvain is now on stage at the GT delivering his [Cocoon does Ajax](http://www.cocoongt.org/speakers/sylvain-wallez-and-max-pfingsthorn.html) message. Brilliant stuff! And it _works_ very well already, considering how new it is.

Jeremy and Upayavira have been contributing some cool stuff in this area during the Hackathon, it'll all be in both the 2.2 milestone and 2.1.8 releases that should appear Real Soon Now at your [friendly neighborhood download site](http://cocoon.apache.org/mirror.cgi).

Max Pfingsthorn is about to take the stage now, to show his cool forms library stuff.
