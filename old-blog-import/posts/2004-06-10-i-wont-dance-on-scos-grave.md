Seems like SCO is slowly but surely [sinking into oblivion](http://biz.yahoo.com/fool/040610/1086881820_2.html). What else do they deserve anyway?

I won't dance on SCO's grave though, as I have fond memories of my first SCO installation (circa 1992) on a PC, using no less than _eighty diskettes_. Those were the Good Old Days, when they were a real company with real products instead of just lawsuits.

I'm thankful for the film-like memory of myself playing "diskette jockey" for hours, to feed the poor PC and transform it into a workstation! Sometimes parts of your life are so weird or irrational that you can't forget ;-)
