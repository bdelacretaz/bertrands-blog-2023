I don't know New Orleans' Mayor [Ray Nagin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Nagin)'s voice so let's hope this is not a fake - this [mp3 interview](http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/WWLAMInterviewNagin.mp3) (also at at [binarybonsai.com](http://binarybonsai.com/files/nomayorinterview.mp3)) gives me shivers.

The section at 10:30 about resource allocation gives a good summary of his view of the problem.

As usual, [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans) is also standing up as a _live_ encyclopedia - fascinating, but so sad.

_Update: as Leo says in the comments, the interview seems to be genuine - thanks Leo!._
