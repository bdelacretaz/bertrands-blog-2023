If you read French you'll find it at [codeconsult.ch/blog](http://codeconsult.ch/blog/).

Now that people around here know what a blog is, this should help in making more local contacts. It will certainly take some time to find out what to write here and what to write there, and anyway I'll use cross-links when appropriate.

See you there!
