Find it [here](http://www.cocoongt.org/Program.html) - an exciting program if you ask me, with talks about what Cocoon is today and quite a few ones about what it will be in the near future.

With my beginner's stuff I'm going to talk at the beginning like last time. But this time the beginner's stuff will be deeper, we're going to study the internals of a complete application, from the build system to database access and applications components management. The abstract is not online yet but should be soon.
