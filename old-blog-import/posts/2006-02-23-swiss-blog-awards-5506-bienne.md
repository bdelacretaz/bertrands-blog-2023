The [Swiss Blog Awards](http://swissblogawards.ch/award/) are in the pipeline, and I've joined the team to be their official (what me official something?) correspondent for this (French-speaking) part of the country.

So, if you need to know something about the event...I _might_ be able to help, but this is all very new for me, just getting up to speed.

The nice part is working with [Urs](http://circle.ch) again, and later getting to know the others.
