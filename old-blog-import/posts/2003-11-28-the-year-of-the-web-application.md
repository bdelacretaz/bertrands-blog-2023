Well, it wasn't hard to predict but I [told you](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000030.html) that 2003 was going to be the Year of the Web Application for Cocoon.

[Ugo Cei](http://www.beblogging.com/blog/20031127-235452) shows that this is real with his success story. There are many other examples if you read (sometimes between the lines) on the mailing lists.

Good news!
