With Open Source being all about openness and collaboration, you'd expect to find only nice and honest people around, right?

Hmmm...recent [reports](http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001789.html) of not so nice [behaviour](http://jroller.com/page/pyrasun/20040517#the_anonymous_fakers) show that all this is [really](http://radio.weblogs.com/0112098/2004/05/18.html#a482) about [mere humans](http://jroller.com/page/rickard/20040517) anyway.

But the nice thing is that cheaters are usually [unmasked](http://www.theserverside.com/discussions/thread.tss?thread_id=25972) one day or another.

_Update: [Mike Spille](http://jroller.com/page/pyrasun/20040524#jboss_employees_admit_guilt) has additional evidence and details._
