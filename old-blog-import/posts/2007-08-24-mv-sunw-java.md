So, according to Jonathan Schwartz (who should know), [Sun](http://www.sun.com) has decided to [change its stock ticker symbol](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/java_is_everywhere) from SUNW to JAVA.

The comments on that blog post are mostly in the _huh?_ category, and I tend too agree...like the one that says _this is sillier than if Apple were to change its ticker to IPOD_.

I'm not sure if JAVA is a good choice as a ticker symbol. MSWY would have sounded better to me. _May the [Schwartz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs) be With You_.
