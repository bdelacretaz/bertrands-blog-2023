The ApacheCon's [Crowdwine](http://apacheconeu2008.crowdvine.com/) site allows you to find out which contributors to a given project are attending the conference (assuming they provide that info, of course).

See for example, the lists of [Sling](http://apacheconeu2008.crowdvine.com/questions/show/9438?tag=sling), [Cocoon](http://apacheconeu2008.crowdvine.com/questions/show/9438?tag=Cocoon) and [httpd](http://apacheconeu2008.crowdvine.com/questions/show/9438?tag=httpd) contributors who have signed up and tagged their profile accordingly.

This should help people make connections there, we'll see how that works out.
