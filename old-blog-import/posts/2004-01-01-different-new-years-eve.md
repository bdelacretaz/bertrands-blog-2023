We didn't feel like fancy restaurants or stay-at-home-and-watch-a-movie this time, and settled for bonfire and sausages in the snow!

Although the temperature [up there](http://www.cols-suisses.ch/jura.htm) at the Mollendruz was -8Â°C we had a great time - I'm sure this will be much more memorable than yet another standard New Year's party.
