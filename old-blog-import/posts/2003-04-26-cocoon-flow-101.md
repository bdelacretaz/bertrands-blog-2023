[Tony Collen](http://manero.org/weblog/) writes an excellent [introduction to the Cocoon flow](http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=GettingStartedWithFlow).

Check it out, and think about how this compares to your favorite web application technology.

Looks like 2003 will be the year of the web application for Cocoon!
