The material for my [LOTS 2005 presentation](http://www.lots.ch/2005/Referate.html?id=045) entitled _what you need to know about Apache Cocoon - a path through the jungle_ is now online at [http://codeconsult.ch/lots/](http://codeconsult.ch/lots/).

It's more of a teaser than anything else though - you'll need to be there for the Real Thing on Friday ;-)

It's the same presentation that I gave at [OSCOM4](http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/supersonic) and at the [Cocoon GetTogether 2004](http://orixo.com/events/gt2003/sessions.html#bertrand), so if you were there no need to bother.
