In an interesting parallel with the previous post, the Java language and platform is [turning 10](http://www.sys-con.com/story/print.cfm?storyid=48538) this year. See the [timeline](http://java.sun.com/features/2000/06/time-line.html).

I started looking at java seriously in the second half of 1996 and contributed to the [Digital Espresso](http://www.mentorsoft.com/DE/) news site for a while, mostly in the summer of 1996. We've come a long way...
