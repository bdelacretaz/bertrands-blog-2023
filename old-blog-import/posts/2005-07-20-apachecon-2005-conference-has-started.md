![apachecon-2005-has-started.jpg](images/apachecon-2005-has-started.jpg)I'm currently sitting with the Pflieger Cocoonistas in the opening plenary. We could use more sleep but we had a great time yesterday night in two successive outdoor cafes. The price/quality ratio of food is really impressive in this town. And the beer is good (even in decent amounts, hint ;-)

Yesterday after the [Blockathon](http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/Blockathon2005Report) I had the pleasure of meeting Ross Gardler, Giacomo Pati, Gregor J. Rothfuss and Brian McCallister, all of whom I knew only in writing until now. As usual, people are even nicer in real life!

Host Zuse (the son of _[Konrad Zuse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse)_ himself) takes the stage for his _origins of the computer_ talk. Delicious accent, it's just starting but it sounds really interesting. He's showing the [1984 Ridley Scott video](http://www.uiowa.edu/~commstud/adclass/1984_mac_ad.html) now.

_Update: Horst Zuse's talk was awesome, a fascinating journey through history. Five hertz clock speeds, mechanical memory - wow! Attendees and presenters of other talks will hopefully notice his extensive use of pictures and videos in slides ;-)_

_Update #2: [Brian](http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/tech/apachecon_eu_2005_2.html) has some details about yesterday evening's conversation. He seems to find the ping tunnel and webpage-compiling-classloared ideas sick and twisted ;-)_
