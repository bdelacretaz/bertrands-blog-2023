At least not until they [fix their Java support](http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t102936.html).

_Update: reading [Ben Galbraith](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/javaben/archive/2007/10/more_on_leopard.html) seems to confirm that the problems are minor and the improvements important, see also the [Java on MacOSX 10.5 release notes](http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/Java/JavaLeopardRN/index.html)._
