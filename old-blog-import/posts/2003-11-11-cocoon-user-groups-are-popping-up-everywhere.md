This morning I was surprised to see a flurry of new [user group pages](http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Search.jsp?query=cocoonusergroup&Search=Find%21) on the Cocoon Wiki. Well, most groups have very few members currently, but it's a start!

Swiss Cocoonistas are going to meet [tonight](http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=CocoonUserGroupSwitzerland) in ZÃ¼rich. I meant to go, but just had to cancel my plans. Too many things going on over here at this time.
