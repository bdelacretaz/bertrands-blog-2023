The great thing about being at ApacheCon is the opportunity for high-bandwidth talks _between_ projects, not only within our own cosy [community](http://cocoon.apache.org).

After discussing the Cocoon goals we had a talk with the Forrest people who are here. They agree with us, great ;-)

Thanks to everybody involved, this is exciting even with the crappy pictures!
