[Bob Moog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moog) is no longer with us, the world of synths will never be the same...[David Battino](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7648) has some memories, and the [movie](http://www.zu33.com/moog/) is finally available, I've just ordered it.

I haven't played a [Mini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog) in a while (I don't have one myself), but next time I do it will be even more special than usual. Hmmm...maybe Minis will start staying in tune under stage lights now ;-)
