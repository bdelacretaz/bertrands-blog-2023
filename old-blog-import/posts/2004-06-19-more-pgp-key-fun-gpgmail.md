I'm testing [GPGMail](http://www.sente.ch/software/GPGMail/) (from almost-neighbours sen:te) to sign and optionally encrypt messages with my newly created PGP key, using the standard macosx mail client.

A fine piece of software! Installation is a breeze, and the integration with Mail looks really good.

_Update: as mentioned in the comments, the URL is now [http://www.gpgmail.org/](http://www.gpgmail.org/). Thanks Alex!_
