Just read the comments [here](http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2007/08/the_latest_on_the_skype_signon.html) for some invaluable advice.

The best advice mentioned there is certainly to call (using Skype?) the US Homeland Security Office: with all their hacking power, it's most certainly these guys who messed up Skype by trying to eavesdrop on my conversations ;-)

_Update: Skype [discloses](http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2007/08/what_happened_on_august_16.html) the real cause._
