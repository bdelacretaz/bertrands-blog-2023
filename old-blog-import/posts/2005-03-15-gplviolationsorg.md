Looks like [gpl-violations.org](http://gpl-violations.org/) is having some success enforcing the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

Although I have other [favorite](http://apache.org/licenses/) [licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), it's good to see people helping make people aware of their obligations when it comes to Open Source (I know..._free software_ if you want ;-) licenses.
