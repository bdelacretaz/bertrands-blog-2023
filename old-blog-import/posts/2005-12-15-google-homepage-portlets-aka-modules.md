Via [Matthew](http://www.silentpenguin.com/archives/2005/12/portal_20_googl.html) - the Google personal homepage now allows integration of third-party [modules](http://www.google.com/apis/homepage/). Did anyone say _massively distributed reliable computing_?

Despite all the hype around Web-you-know-what, something _is_ happening. And I'm happy because it goes towards more turn-it-on-and-use-it computing without all the blue screens of death.
