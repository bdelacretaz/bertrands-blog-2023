A friend of a friend (both non-virtual ;-) is collecting up to 300 used PCs, to use in a computer technology training program in Russian prisons.

If you or your company are getting rid of old PCs, please let me know and I'll make the necessary contacts.

The team is based in Switzerland, but I guess they'd be interesting in collecting equipment from neighbouring countries as well.
