So I tried the Wi-Fi provided by [Boingo](http://www.boingo.com/) at the Atlanta airport the other day, and haven't been too successful with it.

It worked for ten minutes, after which I was banned for _Anomalous Behavior_. I guess that must be my RSS feed reader. You know, this thing even does _several HTTP requests_ at the same time, wow!

Here's what I wrote to _service@boingo.com_ yesterday - haven't heard back from them yet.

> I think your "abnormal amount of activity" detector has been fooled by me starting my RSS news reader, and browsing the web from several browser windows, as I always do (I'm a professional software developer, so I use my computer more intensively that your average traveler I guess). This creates more HTTP requests than someone who's just browsing the web, but the sign-up page didn't indicate any limitations such as these, so I feel like I didn't get the service that I paid for. You might want to adjust that detection, and at least provide a phone number to call, on the error page.

_Update: they did reply today, and according to them I was blacklisted by the ATL airport network. I've asked for a customer service address to complain there._
