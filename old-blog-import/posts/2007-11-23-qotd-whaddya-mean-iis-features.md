Stumbled on this quote from our very own [Ken Coar](http://ken.coar.org/), from an [IRC interview](http://www.linux.com/articles/34135?tid=132&tid=82&tid=90) that took place in February 2004:

> DaMouse404 asks: do you see any features in the IIS that you would like in Apache?
> 
> Ken Coar\] (chuckles) I can't really say, since I don't use IIS and didn't realise that it actually had features.

ROFL.
