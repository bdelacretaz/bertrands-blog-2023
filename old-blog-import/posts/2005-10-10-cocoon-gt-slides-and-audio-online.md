PDF slides _and_ audio recordings of Friday's presentations are available at [cocoongt.org](http://www.cocoongt.org/Slides-and-recordings.html).

Big thanks to [Jack Ivers](http://www.agilepartners.com/) for the audio recordings! This adds a lot of value to the event.

Make sure to have a look at [Andrew Savory](http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/archives/000900.html)'s _simplifying Cocoon_ slides - beautiful, and food for thought.
