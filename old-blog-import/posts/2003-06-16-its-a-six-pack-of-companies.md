Looks like my [predictions](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000078.html) were slightly off-target, but for once real life is [better than fiction](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=105575905918084&w=2)

To me [Orixo](http://www.orixo.com) looks like a small step for man, but a giant leap for Open Source - there are many examples where people and companies agreeing that sharing is better than hiding have been very successful (remember [midi](http://www.midi.org/)?).

My warmest wishes to the Orixo people, it will be interesting to see what comes out of this move.

_Update: [Stefano Mazzocchi](http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/) shares [his views](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-users&m=105579667528665&w=2) on Orixo._
