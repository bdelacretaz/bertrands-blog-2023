Found The Pragmatic Programmer's [excellent solution](http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi/Monitor/Loginfo2Rss.rdoc) to generate an RSS feed out of CVS loginfo messages.

Installation is easy if Ruby is available on the server, and installing Ruby in one's home directory is also easy if you don't have root access. The 10-minute test is a success.

By the way, the [source code](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/downloads/commit2rss/commit2rss.rb.txt) is a really good example of the power of scripting. Excluding the comment header, the whole thing fits on a single Powerbook screen ;-)
