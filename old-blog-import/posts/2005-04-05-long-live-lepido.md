Sylvain Wallez [announces](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-users&m=111272244631496&w=2) the [Eclipse Lepido](http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-lepido/index.html) project, aimed at building open source IDE tools for [Apache Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org), based on the Eclipse platform.

With Cocoon maturing as an applications platform, it's great to see efforts towards better tools. As it stands now, Cocoon is very powerful in the right hands, but can be hard to grasp for people more used to visual tools.

Lepido, based on an [existing set](http://www.anyware-tech.com/en/developper/EclipsePlugins/SitemapEditor.html) of eclipse plugins developed by Sylvain's [Anyware Technologies](http://www.anyware-tech.com/) company, looks like a great starting point for such a project.

I won't join the project for now, as I already have too many pans in my oven. But still: long live Lepido!
