Spent yesterday evening in a [nice village](http://www.jazzphone.ch/evenements/2003_ollon/2003_ollon.htm) listening to some great jazz - its been a long time since I went to a pure jazz concert (last concert was [Maceo](http://maceo.com/) who is just incredible on stage).

First on stage yesterday was [Philip Catherine](http://www.gitaarnet.nl/magazine/artikelen/interviews/philipcatherine.php3) trio: very tasty music, so much energy even in quiet pieces. It was the first time I saw him on stage and he's a pleasure to hear and watch (I know the page is in Dutch but it's the only one I could find with recent pictures).

Then [Joey De Francesco](http://www.joeydefrancesco.com/) - I didn't like the first tune (which unfortunately prompted several people to leave) but after that it was just incredible: virtuosity like I've never seen at the organ, yet musicality and lots of power!

A great evening - now back to work,still some deadlines to meet in the next days...
