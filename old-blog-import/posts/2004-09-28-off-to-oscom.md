Leaving at 5:50 AM tomorrow to catch an early train to ZÃ¼rich for [oscom 4](http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/), I'm looking forward to meet Massimo, Ugo, Jeremias, Michi, Gregor, Andreas and many others that I will be ashamed tomorrow of not mentioning here ;-)

And the dog needs a walk - won't have too much sleep tonight.
