One of my favorites authors is [back](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2004_10_01_archive.asp#109772777429831769) to weblogging, because _as the Spanish philospher Unamuno said, "At times, to be silent is to lie."_

His [Billy story](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2004_10_01_archive.asp#109781563354113574) is delicious. What happened to Billy?

Via [Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/14/Election2004) with whom I agree very much about firing the boss:

> If you’re running a company and there’s a general perception that your CEO is an asshole, eventually it won’t matter that much whether he really is or isn’t; the perception will become an obstacle

Let's hope the boss gets fired.
