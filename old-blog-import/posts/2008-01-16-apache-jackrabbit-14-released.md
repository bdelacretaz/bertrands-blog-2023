Congratulations to the [Jackrabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org) team for their [1.4 release](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/downloads.cgi#Apache%20Jackrabbit%201.4).

I've been using the Jackrabbit trunk in the last few months for my work on [Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling), and although 1.4 is not a "big bang" release, the many things added and fixed make a lot of difference.

See [Jukka's post](http://jukkaz.wordpress.com/2008/01/16/apache-jackrabbit-14-is-available/) for more details.
