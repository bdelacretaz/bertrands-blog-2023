The CocoonGT team just wrote the best [description](http://www.cocoongt.org/FAQ.html) of a Hackathon that I've seen to date. At least as seen from a Cocoonista's point of view: other communities might do it slightly differently.

Wikipedia also has a good, but less concise, [explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) of the word.

By the way, I think it's written _hackathon_ with an H like in _marathon_ - that's where the word comes from.
