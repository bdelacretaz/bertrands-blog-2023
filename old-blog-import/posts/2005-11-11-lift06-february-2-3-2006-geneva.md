Just got news from [lift06](http://www.lift06.org/), a _a conference about new technologies and people_ in Geneva next February.

The [program](http://www.lift06.org/doku.php/about:program) looks exciting, with contributions from Cory Doctorow, Robert Scoble and Jeffrey Huang, among others.

I'll most probably be there, drop me a line if we know each other and you're going!
