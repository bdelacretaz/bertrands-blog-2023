[![carsten-felix-sling-award-jax.jpg](images/carsten-felix-sling-award-jax.jpg)](http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/main/jaxaward2.html)Last week, [Apache Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling) won the fifth prize at the [JAX Innovation Award](http://jax-award.de/jax_award/index_eng.php).

Carsten, seen here playing happy Sling committers with Felix, writes about how Sling [Sling brings the fun back](http://www.osoco.org/blog/?p=33) in web development.

I haven't done much development myself with Sling yet, as I've been mostly working on the framework itself, but just writing the simple webloader stuff makes me very much echo what Carsten says: Sling is indeed fun and efficient to work with.
