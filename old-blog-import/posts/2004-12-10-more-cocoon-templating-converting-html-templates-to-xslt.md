I've been playing with this today: using XSLT to generate XSLT transforms based on simple HTML templates, to make it easier for people to create presentation pipelines for Cocoon.

The [results](http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/HtmlToXsltExperiments) are very positive. Can't wait to hear the reactions on cocoon-dev (or right here: polite comments \*are\* enabled).

I know many Cocooners have been doing stuff like this already, but I don't think we've ever put our collective minds around creating enough samples or documentation to make this a mainstream part of Cocoon - yet IMHO it deserves to be at least a well-documented sample.

I've put the (small) source code on the wiki to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute, we'll see if this mini-project gets a community...

_Update: [Christian Stocker](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/further-improvements-on-xsl-tal.html) updates his TAL-based version of a similar thing, stealing (as suggested;-) the declarative rules idea._
