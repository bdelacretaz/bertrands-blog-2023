[struktur.de](http://struktur.de) is offering a $6000 [bounty](http://www.lisog.org/projekte/supported_projects/bounty-programm/description-en) for writing a codec compatible with the Nelly Moser one used by Flash.

This would be a Good Thing to have as, currently, audio recorded with the Flash Media Server cannot be converted to open formats, due to the use of this closed codec.
