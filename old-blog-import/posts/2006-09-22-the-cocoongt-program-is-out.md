The [program](http://www.cocoongt.org/PROGRAM.html) of the Cocoon GetTogether 2006 (Amsterdam, October 4th, [Hackathon](http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/GT2006Hackaton) on 2nd and 3rd) is online, and there's some space left. With 71 signups as of today, and a packed program, we're looking forward to it!

I'm going to show a prototype based on [Solr](http://incubator.apache.org/solr/) and [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/), combined with [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/) to create a powerful yet simple content repository.

Hmm...let's say I _hope_ to talk about that - as I'm talking last, I'll have to make sure people keep to their assigned time slots. I'll bring a Swiss watch I guess...
