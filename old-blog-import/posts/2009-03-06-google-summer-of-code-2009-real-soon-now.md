The 2009 logo is fantastic, isn't it? Flower power is not dead apparently.

[Google Summer Of Code 2009](http://code.google.com/soc/) starts soon, open source organizations can sign up starting March 9th (a _very_ important date planet-wide anyway), and students can sign up starting March 23rd.

An [A4 flyer](http://google-summer-of-code.googlecode.com/files/GSoC2009Flyer.pdf) is available to display in your school, or anywhere geeks graze.

Assuming we're accepted as an organization, projects of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org) will be listed on our [wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2009). I'm probably going to suggest one or two [Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling)\-related projects.

Philip Johnson's video presentation (below) gives a good overview of the program and of its requirements, for students.
