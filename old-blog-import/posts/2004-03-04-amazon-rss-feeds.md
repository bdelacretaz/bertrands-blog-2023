Amazon.com has added a number of useful [RSS feeds](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/xs/syndicate.html/104-7358920-9790361) to their site.

The URLs are not exactly models of simplicity:

`http://xml-na.amznxslt.com/onca/xml3?mode=electronics   &bcm=Electronics%3A%20Software%3A%20All%20Software   &t=webservices-20&dev-t=amznRss&type=lite&page=1   &ct=text/xml&sort=+salesrank   &f=http://xml.amazon.com/xsl/xml-rss091.xsl   &BrowseNodeSearch=229534`

but it's good to see [RSS](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html) becoming mainstream!
