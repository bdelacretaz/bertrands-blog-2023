The [Apache Tika](http://lucene.apache.org/tika/) and [Apache Pig](http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/) podlings where I was mentor, have graduated a few weeks ago, both in the "galaxy" of [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org)\-related projects. Congrats and good luck!

Having lots of Copious Free Time as usual (not!), I have signed up as a mentor for the new and exciting [ESME](http://incubator.apache.org/esme/) project, a _secure and highly scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform_, written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). Looking forward to seeing where this goes.

The Apache [Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org) has been very busy in 2008, with many innovative things happening. It's not always easy to manage, with so many people and projects involved, but the results are very encouraging.

I wonder when the ASF will hit the 100 projects mark...probably in 2009 already, or early 2010.
