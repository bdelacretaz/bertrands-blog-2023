[Solr 1.1](http://people.apache.org/dist/incubator/solr/1.1/) is the first release of this [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/)\-based [search server](http://incubator.apache.org/solr/).

See the [tutorial](http://incubator.apache.org/solr/tutorial.html), the [resources page](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrResources) or (shameless plug ahead) my [xml.com article](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/08/09/solr-indexing-xml-with-lucene-andrest.html) to learn more about this great tool. Solr is already used in [many places](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers) for some serious indexing.

Last Wednesday we demoed the Solr-based indexing in our current project, and as someone put it, _it seems like the search results arrive before the submit button bounces back up_.

Can you tell I'm a bit enthusiastic?
