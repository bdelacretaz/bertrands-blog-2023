According to MSN there are [365 web sites](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=linux&FORM=SMCRT) about Linux on the web. Wow, thank you Microsoft for making such sophisticated search technology accessible to us poor mortals. Just imagining all the RAM you must use to store this index makes me dizzy.

The page ranking seems to use amazing technology as well, look at the fourth link:

Looks like they're using the FOERA algorithm here (Forces Of Evil Ranking Algorithm).
