title: "great XHTML/CSS design at openweb"

[openweb.eu.org](http://openweb.eu.org/) has the best XHTML/CSS design that I've seen in a long time, including accessibility and style switching. It's in French but this shouldn't prevent you from enjoying the design.

And it's _beautiful_ and _readable_.

I'm writing this here to remember to use it as an example. In fact I stumbled on it because they wrote about the many [ripoffs](http://openweb.eu.org/humeurs/plagiats/) that they see around the web, so it's certainly an example for many people already.
