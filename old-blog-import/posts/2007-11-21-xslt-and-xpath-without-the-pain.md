Here are my slides from last week's [ApacheCon](http://www.us.apachecon.com). That's mostly an excuse to play with the cool [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz/xslt-without-the-pain) embedding widget, as the slides aren't really standalone: you might need me to make sense of them ;-)

\[slideshare id=70335&doc=xslt-without-the-pain995&w=425\]

The talk went well, including some challenging questions and feedback, which is cool.

Someone with a strong background in rules-based languages came up to talk, and made me realize that my talk is really targeted at people who come from a procedural language background. People who know Prolog or a related language have an easier time moving to XSLT that those who come from Java or C, so my "avoid procedural constructs" line doesn't really apply to them.
