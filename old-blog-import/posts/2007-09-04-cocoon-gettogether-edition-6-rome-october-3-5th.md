[![spqr.gif](images/spqr.gif)](http://www.cocoongt.org/)Sign up for the sixth [Cocoon GetTogether](http://www.cocoongt.org/) in Rome, October 3-5th!

I might not make it this year, except maybe for the last (and most important) day, if the bytes align just right.

But with Gianugo at the helm, I'm sure it'll be great, so maybe not _andiamo_, but at least _andate_!
