I wish I could hear some of the people I met in Australia speak out [The Chaos](http://www.mipmip.dsl.pipex.com/tidbits/pronunciation.shtml).

[Andrew](http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/archives/000334.html) offers a very nice [audio rendition](http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/videos/chaos.mov). I'll work on it when I find some time (anybody wants to sponsor my retirement?)
