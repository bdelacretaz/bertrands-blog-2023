Didier Donsez sent me a note about this meeting, details can be found [here](http://www-adele.imag.fr/osgi/meeting3/message.txt).

The agenda mostly talks about administrative stuff, so it's not going to be exciting technical or strategy discussions I guess. But it's still good to know that such a group exists.
