[![obama_3DLogo.jpg](http://bdelacretaz.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/obama-3dlogo.jpg)](http://barackobama.com)Being in the US to watch the Obama speech yesterday evening on the big screen in the [hotel lobby](http://www.us.apachecon.com/c/acus2008/) was really cool - people cheering, standing ovations and I could feel the hope in the air.

Some people's expectations are obviously optimistic, but hearing a president (elect) that feels genuine and honest is very reassuring.

American friends note that technology will be back in the White House - of course, with a president who selected [one of the Facebook founders](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/technology/07hughes.html?_r=1&oref=slogin) to run his Internet campaign, things should get better in this respect.

/me happy.
