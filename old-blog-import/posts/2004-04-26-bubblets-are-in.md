I've (shamelessly) lifted Tim Bray's [bubblets](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/21/CosmoBubbles) idea and added them here.

The bubblets query [technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) for weblogs that point to my entries (yes, it _does_ happen sometimes).

Dunno yet what this might bring, but "connecting" to more interesting weblogs (or rather to the interesting people behind them) is always welcome.
