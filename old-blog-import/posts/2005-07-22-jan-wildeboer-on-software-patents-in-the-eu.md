Jan Wildeboer is on stage now, I'm not going to blog a summary but just a link to the [Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure](http://ffii.org/) of which he is a member. They have lots of information and links about software patents in the EU.

A really good talk! One of his conclusions is _Dont' let the Megacorps define the law_. I couldn't agree more.
