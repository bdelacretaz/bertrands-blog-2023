Continuing on the nomadic theme: [Shinux](http://www.shinux.org/) (in french) is a Linux distribution meant to be embedded in an USB storage device. Except the website with the awful integrated scroll bar, this looks great!

Get it out of your pocket, plug it into a PC which can boot from USB and you're in business, including a word processor, browser, media player, Apache web server and much more. I didn't try it but I'd love to.

There's an article in english at [linuxdevices.com](http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS4097060580.html).
