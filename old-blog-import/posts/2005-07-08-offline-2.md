I'll be offline next week, on vacation, disconnected from everything as much as possible (as usual, the only gizmo is a turned off cell phone).

As often before holidays, this week has been a bit hectic between finishing stuff, getting a spare fork tube for the old bike before selling it (I'll tell you about the new one soon, it's YELLOW), finding my swimsuit etc...

Then the week after it's going to be [ApacheCon EU 2005](http://apachecon.com) in Stuttgart, starting with the [Blockathon](http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/Blockathon). This sounds like two really cool weeks!

In the meantime, my Cocoon-based stuff is making interesting progress in the vicinity of [nouvo.ch](http://www.nouvo.ch) - I'll have more about this in a few weeks.
