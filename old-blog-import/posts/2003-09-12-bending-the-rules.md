I love these communities - yesterday I made a slightly rule-bending [proposal](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=fop-dev&m=106327328212235&w=2) to the FOP project, which triggered a rather harsh [response](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=fop-dev&m=106328403023006&w=2).

I was in orbit again yesterday (no, it's not illegal substances, just too many things competing for my time) and didn't see the answer before this morning, but sure enough, [people](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=fop-dev&m=106328860528335&w=2) have already [replied](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=fop-dev&m=106330268215242&w=2) and put things [straight](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=fop-dev&m=106330619820195&w=2).

Thanks FOPpers! And next time I will use \[wildwildwildidea\] instead of \[proposal\] when I have wild ideas ;-)

_Update: storm is [over](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=fop-dev&m=106339266312267&w=2). I love these communities, you learn so much!_
