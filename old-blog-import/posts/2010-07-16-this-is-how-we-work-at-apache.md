I just had to (re-)explain how the [Apache](http://apache.org) way of working makes a difference by enabling a continuous flow of information between developers.

No more begging for reports, no more boring meetings where you only exchange information: who could say no to that?

Here it is for your enjoyment. This is the same thing that I've been saying in my recent [talks](http://www.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz) on this topic, reduced to the bare minimum.

- All technical discussions and decisions on public mailing lists.
- _Speak in URLs_: if you reference something (discussion, vote, code...anything) include its URL, which must be permanent.
- Shared code repository, commit early, commit often (as in: daily at least, from day one)
- Commit events sent to mailing lists and/or RSS feeds to which people can subscribe.
- Shared issue tracker and _"if you're working on something it must be an issue in the tracker"_ so that progress reports are automatic. Also generates mail/RSS events.
- Commits are linked to tracker issue IDs - by speaking in URLs in your commit messages, mostly.
- Automatic archiving of all this information, for self-service access.

All this is public and centrally accessible of course, so everybody gets the same information.

The main reluctance that I see when trying to convince people to work in this way is the fear of exposing your mistakes and initial bad designs in public. My answer is to _just get over it_: you'd find tons of such blunders if you were to analyze my work at Apache in the last ten years, yet I'm reasonably alive and kicking.
