[Firebird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/) looks very nice under macosx, and compared to [Camino](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/) it **is** the real Mozilla, so that [LiveHTTPHeaders](http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/) is supported, for example.

Firebird also brings back the cool [Type Ahead Find](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/typeaheadfind.html) feature that I talked about [a while ago](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000009.html).
