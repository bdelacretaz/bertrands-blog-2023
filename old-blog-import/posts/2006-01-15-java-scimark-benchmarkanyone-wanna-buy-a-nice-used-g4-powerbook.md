Last post led to the [Java SciMark 2.0](http://math.nist.gov/scimark2/) benchmark. If you need more shame for your Powerbook's Java performance, look at the [complete results](http://math.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ScimarkSummary?complete).

You need the complete results...because the Powerbook is too far away in the list to show up on the main results page.
