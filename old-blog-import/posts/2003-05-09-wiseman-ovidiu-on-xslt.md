Great ideas like [this one](http://www.webweavertech.com/ovidiu/weblog/archives/000255.html) make me go _why didn't I think of this before_...

Using XSLT for mapping XML data to java classes opens interesting perspectives (did somebody say _form beans to business beans_?), and as Ovidiu says we usually get XSLT for free because we're using it for other stuff anyway.

Looks like these 46-hour days are really going to be packed!
