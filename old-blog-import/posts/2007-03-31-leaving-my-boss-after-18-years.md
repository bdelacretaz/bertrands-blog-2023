As we all know, [today](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000283.html) is the perfect day for important announcements.

After being my own boss for the last 18 years, I'll ([also](http://www.osoco.org/archives/2007/03/new_day_job.html)) be joining [Day Software](http://www.day.com)'s R&D team, starting in May after [ApacheCon](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/program/speaker/27).

Leaving my current projects and the [teaching gigs](http://www.comem.ch/) has been a big decision, but the job looks _really_ interesting, and a good opportunity to step up to more complex and [larger](http://www.day.com/site/en/index/customers/customers0.html.html) projects.

My involvement in [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org/) and [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) will probably suffer from the move, as it looks like I'm moslty going to be working with other (open source) tools. I feel bad about Solr as it's only a [few months](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000738.html) since I was invited as a committer, right before my first contacts with Day...that's life I guess, one sometimes needs to leave (nice) people and (cool) projects to move on. Being less involved with Cocoon also means leaving nice people and a cool project, but in that case I've been involved for much longer so it doesn't feel as weird.

I thought my next language would be spanish (because I like the sound and it's spoken in wide areas of the world), but it looks like it'll rather be [Schwitzerditsch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_German), we√Øl es au toll isch. It's not a real requirement for the job, but I don't want to miss too many coffee time jokes either ;-)

Looking forward to it!
