Congratulations [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/archives/000123.html) on your election, and above all many thanks for accepting the job.

Many thanks as well to [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/) who stepped down after about one year, as was originally planned. You did a great job man!

For those of you who are not up to snuff on ASF speak, being the "PMC chairman" means that Sylvain is now the _interface_ between the Cocoon **P**roject **M**anagement **C**ommittee and the Apache Software Foundation board of directors.

So, if I understand correctly, the PMC itself is the _implementation_, right? ;-)

Which means: we have to do our best to not let Sylvain alone in dealing with unsexy stuff like licensing issues, project reports and other administrative matters. Let's be an efficient implementation!
