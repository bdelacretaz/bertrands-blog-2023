[Maxxuss](http://maxxuss.hotbox.ru/) has released a first set of patches which apparently allow macosx to run on a generic x86 computer (but SSE2 is required).

So, either Apple has been technically unable to make their OS crackproof...or they didn't _really_ want it to stay locked to Apple hardware...

Via the [OSx86 project](http://www.osx86project.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=116&Itemid=2).

_Update: In the meantime, maxxuss has got a new [new blog](http://maxxuss.theblog.cc/)._
