[![280slides.jpg](/assets/images/280slides.jpg)](http://280slides.com/Editor/)Check it out [yourself](http://280slides.com/Editor/) - seems like these guys' [Objective J](http://www.wait-till-i.com/2008/06/05/north280-bring-keynote-to-the-web/) might help (just a bit) in creating rich browser-based applications. The editor reproduces much of Keynote's lush UI and functionality in a browser, with no apparent performance problems.

My [two-slide presentation](http://280slides.com/Viewer/?user=756&name=testing&fullscreen) might not be enough to really judge the application...but that's a start.
