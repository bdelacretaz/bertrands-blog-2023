What did you say? Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. <!-- excerpt -->Your friend, Marty. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady.

Listen, Doc. Take care. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Did you hurt your head? Go.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? That's right. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.
