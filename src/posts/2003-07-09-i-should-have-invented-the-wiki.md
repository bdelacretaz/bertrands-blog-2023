At least I'm happy to have convinced some people to use Wikis, which are showing up everywhere these days.

It was not me who convinced the OSCON people but it is great to see them using a Wiki as the conference bulletin board. Makes a lot of sense for [rides](http://oscon.kwiki.org/index.cgi?RideBoard) for example. I have a new point for Wikis: they help optimize traffic to reduce pollution ;-)
