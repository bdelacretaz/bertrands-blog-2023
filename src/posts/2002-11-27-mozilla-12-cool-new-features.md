Mozilla 1.2 is out with two new features that I like a lot: [Type Ahead Find](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/typeaheadfind.html) and XML prettyprinting.

Too bad the [Composite Editor](http://composite.mozdev.org/index.html) does not seem to work properly with this release. Hopefully it will be fixed soon. I also had to dig deeper to find out how to activate XML prettyprinting - adding _user\_pref("layout.xml.prettyprint", true);_ to the prefs.js file of my profile did the trick, and the results are wonderful.
