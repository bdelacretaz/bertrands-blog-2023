[![speaking-in-urls-2.jpg](/assets/images/speaking-in-urls-2.jpg "speaking-in-urls-2.jpg")](http://grep.codeconsult.ch/2009/04/01/open-source-collaboration-tools-are-good-for-you-relooked-and-live-tomorrow/)I've seen about five examples just today where _speaking in URLs_ (I spoke about that [before](http://grep.codeconsult.ch/2009/04/01/open-source-collaboration-tools-are-good-for-you-relooked-and-live-tomorrow/), slide 27) would have saved people from misunderstandings, and avoided wasting our collective time.

When writing about something that has an URL on a project's mailing list, for example, pointing to it precisely makes a big difference. You will save people's time, avoid misunderstandings and over time create a goldmine of linked information on the Web. It's not a web without links, ok?

Writing _[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-931](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-931)_ (or at least _SLING-931_ if that's the local convention) is so much clearer than writing about "the jcrinstall web console problem". You might know what the latter is right now, but how about 6 months later when someone finds your message in the mailing lists archives?

Of course, _all_ your important technical things have stable URLs, right?
