If you're around Montreux, Switzerland this summer you shouldn't miss [Akua](http://www.akua.ch/), _the tidal wave show_ (the place is St-Tryphon and the language is French).

The Karl’s kühne Gassenschau team is a crazy bunch of street theatre people, and their shows are always _more_ that you can imagine. More fun, more crazyness. Recommended!
