[![restlet.jpg](http://bdelacretaz.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/restlet.jpg)](http://blog.noelios.com/2008/11/25/cartoon-presents-restlet/)I love cartoons - proud owner of Tex Avery's collection on DVD. And the Shadoks as well.

After [Chrome](http://grep.codeconsult.ch/2008/09/02/google-chrome-cartoon-rocks/) it's RESTlet's turn to jump on the [tech cartoons](http://blog.noelios.com/2008/11/25/cartoon-presents-restlet/) bandwagon. Not as ambitious as Chrome's, but great stuff!
