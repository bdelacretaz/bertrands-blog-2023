Microsoft just announced a [test drive](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/beta/testdrive.mspx?showIntro=n) program for Office 2007. So that people can kick the virtual tires of this bloated pile of bits software.

To which the OpenOffice folks respond with their [Like the test drive? keep the car!](http://why.openoffice.org/) program. Which in fact has been going for quite some time ;-)

Is OpenOffice less bloated than M$ Office? Not that much actually, but at least you don't need to sell your virtual soul to the Dark Side to use it.

Me, I try to avoid word processors anyway. Write content, not pages!
