This morning while [flying](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000589.html) to work I listened to [Tim Bray's ETech 2006 presentation](http://itconversations.com/shows/detail1155.html) on [Atom](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage). Very interesting! Tim outlines several known problems with RSS, and how Atom avoids them.

Phil Windley has written a [short summary](http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/03/tim_bray_on_ato.shtml) of the talk, but it's worth listening to, if only for the insights into how Atom came to life.

Atom is not just a feed format, and with the [Atom Publishing Protocol](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-09.txt) it makes a very interesting API for content management and retrieval.
