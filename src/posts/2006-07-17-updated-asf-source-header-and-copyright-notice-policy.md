This is mostly of interest to committers of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org), but it might help clarify the ASF license and copyright policy for others: the updated [ASF Source Header and Copyright Notice Policy](http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html) has just been published.

The important difference is the removal of the ASF copyright notice in individual source files, to avoid confusion as contributors maintain their copyright ownership on the works they submit.

All ASF releases distributed after September 1, 2006 will have to comply with this policy, and a few scripts are available to break your source code automatically update existing files. See the above mentioned page for details.
