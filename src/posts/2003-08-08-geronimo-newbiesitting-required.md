Looks like the [Geronimo](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/geronimo.html) project has a big _potential_ community of contributors: I got 104 messages from geronimo-dev in about 12 hours, most of them from people saying either "I'm new to Apache, please help me understand this" or "this is my first Open-Source project" or "I'm a great J2EE developer, I want to be in it". There are already many discussions about design details although most people have not seen any of the existing code...

It will be interesting to see how/if this develops into an active community. The cynical point of view would be to say "newbies will go away after they hear the word 'CVS'", which is probably true for some of them, but the interest and expressed motivations seem to fly high. Wait and see...
