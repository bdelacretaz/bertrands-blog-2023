I just tested [NeoOffice](http://www.neooffice.org/) for macosx, which [Urs](http://www.circle.ch) showed me last week, and my first impressions are very positive.

NeoOffice/J is said to use _a combination of Carbon and Java_ to run the [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org) code natively on macosx. Intriguing, but is seems to work very well indeed.

So, it runs without X (cool), prints natively (cool) and feels really good to use (cool++). The looks are still a bit neolithic (which is what _Neo_ means by the way), but who cares? It seems to do job just fine.

I'm going to use it for office documents, of which I do very few by the way. I've learned to hate word processors since moving to more structured ways of working on text.

I still need to have a look at [pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/) though, but that's another story...
