I just asked [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) _who were the initial committers of the [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org/) project_ (I was there), and here’s the answer that I got:

> The initial committers of the Apache Sling project were listed in the project's first announcement on the Apache Sling website in September 2009. The initial committers listed were:
> 
> - Bertrand Delacretaz
> - Felix Meschberger
> - Carsten Ziegeler
> - Marcel Offermans
> - David Nuescheler
> - Brian Moseley
> 
> These individuals were instrumental in creating the initial codebase for Apache Sling and laying the groundwork for the project's growth and success.

That's a well written answer indeed, with some correct facts, but the last three people listed were _not_ initial committers of that project - actually not even committers at any time, in the ASF sense of the term. See the details below, if you care.

That's just one example, but I hope you are not surprised by the subtle factual errors in such a well-written answer, coming from such a tool. If you are surprised, let’s hear what Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1601731295792414720) in December 2022:

> ChatGPT is incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness. it’s a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. it’s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.

Having such automated tools to help us write better prose is fantastic, and ChatGPT & friends have progressed tremendously recently, but we shouldn’t fall into the trap on relying on them for facts.

They are likely to give you **Well Written, but Subtly Wrong answers**, that you’ll have to check and correct yourself.

I think this deserves a new acronym – remember, you saw it here first!

_A text that is Well Written, but Subtly Wrong, as Generative AI tools are likely to produce in early 2023._

Here are the factual errors in the above answer. The truth can be found in the Sling [incubation](https://lists.apache.org/thread/bjjqpsxs5dd5rkhvdgj0zokcdj1dp36q) and [graduation](https://lists.apache.org/thread/t4ybvc540n5xq728k29h8hl85y41bwv8) proposals, which both list a set of initial committers, one for incubation and one for the top-level Apache Sling project. Including people from either list could be considered correct.

- Although Marcel Offermans is active in other ASF projects and I know him personally, he’s never been a Sling committer. He might have been loosely involved through his extensive OSGI-related activities, so seeing his name here is not completely surprising. But not a committer and not included in the above lists.
- David Nuescheler can definitely be linked to Sling, but was not an initial committer.
- I don't remember seeing the name Brian Moseley in the Sling community and haven't found a mention of this name in the Sling mailing lists archive. Seeing it in this list _is_ a complete surprise.
