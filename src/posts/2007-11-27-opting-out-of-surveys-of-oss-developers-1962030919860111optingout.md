After receiving way too many emails asking me to fill out way too many survey forms about how open source projects work, I'm opting out of any such surveys.

Being in a _lazyness is a virtue_ mood tonight, I'll refer to [Steve Loughran's explanations](http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=E47B0A97528CCD973524C9A938A2E8D9) of where researchers can find info without having to invade our Copious Free Time.

And let's make this meme measurable: put _1962030919860111OptingOut_ in your posts if you do the same, so that we can check the [Google Number](http://www.google.com/search?q=1962030919860111OptingOut) of opt-outs. It's zero right now ;-)
