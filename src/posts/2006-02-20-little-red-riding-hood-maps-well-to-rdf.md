Explaining the [basics of RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/) to students today, I used the first phrases of [Little Red Riding Hood](http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue06/features/texavery4.htm) to create a set of example triples based on a real world situation (well, _almost_ real).

After two phrases, the board was already full of triples about mothers, grandmas, the little girl, her hood, baskets, etc.

It's a fun example, and everybody knew the problem domain quite well, which helps. Students even discovered inference by themselves, mentioning that two "is mother of" predicates on a path imply an "is grandma of" predicate.

By the way, if you haven't seen Tex Avery's version of the story, you absolutely have to - it's incredible.
