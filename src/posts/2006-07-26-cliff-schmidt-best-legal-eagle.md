Congratulations to [Cliff Schmidt](http://people.apache.org/~cliffs/), the [ASF](http://apache.org/foundation)'s V.P. of Legal Affairs!

Cliff just [won](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2006/07/and-winners-are.html) a Google-O'Reilly Open Source Award as _Best Legal Eagle_. The awards recognize _individuals who have worked tirelessly on their projects and in their community roles to make significant contributions to open source_.

Those who try to follow the ASF's legal aspects will easily agree about the _tireless_ bit - Cliff's been working long and hard to make things happen on the legal side of the ASF. Which, with a spectrum of people ranging from law-aware US citizens to overworked IT techies to european rebels, is...well, not an easy task.

So congratulations Cliff, this is very well deserved!

Cliff's not alone in this, five people have won an award, see the [Google Code Blog](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2006/07/and-winners-are.html) post for more info.
