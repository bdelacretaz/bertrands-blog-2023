Like someone who would have the bright idea of [patenting a filesystem from the dinousaur era](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/11/microsoft_wins_patent_case/print.html).

Of course, if FAT _was_ "invented" by M$, doing this is certainly 100% ok from the legal point of view.

But from the _shame factor_ point of view? You guys sleep well?

On the positive side: this makes a perfect case for software with [clean open licenses](http://apache.org/licenses/)!
