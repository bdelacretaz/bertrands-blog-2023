![guy-goma.jpg](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/guy-goma.jpg) So this Guy, waiting for a job interview at a BBC office, is rushed to a TV studio, to answer questions live about the Apple vs. Apple case. Except he's not the right Guy...

A noble man has got to do his job - and give the audience what they expect. [Guy Goma](http://guygoma.com/) answers the questions in a _perceptually real_ way and gets instant fame. Is he really worse than the usual experts?

The [video](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4774429.stm) will stay as an important piece of our TV history.

Via [pieceoplastic](http://pieceoplastic.com/index.php/2331/guy-goma-for-president/) who's got a great visual analysis of Guy Goma's initial reaction ("it's not me - but what the heck").
