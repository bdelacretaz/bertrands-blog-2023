Wow. Have a look at Korg's new [OASYS](http://www.korg.com/gear/product_info.asp?A_PROD_NO=OASYS) synth, said to run _atop Linux underpinnings_. Chalk up another one for open source's ubiquity.

I can't help the little pinch in there as my first synth was a (brand new at the time) [Korg MS-20](http://www.vintagesynth.org/korg/ms20.shtml). Those were the days ;-)
