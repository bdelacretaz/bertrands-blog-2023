The previous post reminds me of a business idea that we had with my wife a while ago.

The concept is simple: the website would have just one page with this clever line:

> You're rich and stupid?  
> Send us your money, and half of your problems will be solved!

people can then send money directly online, and live happily (or half-happily) ever after.

We're only starting on that one, currently looking for VC funds to reserve the domain name. Funds will also help us find a way to make the site Web 2.0-compatible (we will need some Ajax technology for the payment process, for sure).

So we need _lots_ of money, ideally from people who can relate to the above line. Drop me a line if you're interested!
