![biketec-flyer.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/biketec-flyer.jpg)Today I finally received my Flyer electric bicycle!

It's not that the delivery took that long, but the first time that I tried one was 1999, and I've been looking to buy one since then.

The battery life wasn't up to snuff then, but today I just came back from work (12 fairly steep kilometers) using less than 30% of the capacity, so I'll be able to do the round-trip to work on a charge.

We'll see how I do in the coming winter, but I hope to use it all year round to commute to work - it takes me only about 30 minutes more round-trip in total, but this will give me more than an hour of exercise a day!

It's not exactly cheap (about 2500 euro for my high endish C8+ version), but the quality is really good - and the city of Lausanne sponsors buyers who live or work on its territory, well done! More info on the [www.biketec.ch](http://www.biketec.ch) web site (not in english at the moment apparently).

Riding this thing is way cool, the electric assistance is very natural, makes you feel bionic at times! I don't think I'd have enough courage to do the steep climb back every day on a normal bike, but with this thing it should be possible. Time will tell..
