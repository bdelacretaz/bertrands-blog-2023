There's been much discussion about [this](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html) in the last few days. [Bernhard Seefeld](http://www.bernhardseefeld.ch/archives/000102.html) (the man behind the great [map.search.ch](http://map.search.ch/Immensee/Artherstrasse-60)) has a good point in saying that some community request for comments could have made this much better.

Why not take the opportunity to give more semantic meaning to weblog comments for example, instead of blindly _nofollowing_ everything?

Bernhard links to [Ben Hammersley](http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2005/01/20/let_no_fellow_nofollow_lest_we_all_lie_fallow.html) who thinks this might actually _increase_ the comment spam activity, as lowering the efficiency of a free thing should increase the use of said thing. Makes sense to me.

Let's hope our not-evil giant thinks a second time about this.
