![apachecon_hackathon_starts.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/apachecon_hackathon_starts.jpg)Here's a view of the Cocoonistas corner, we're just getting started.

Torsten, Sylvain, Reinhard, Daniel, Alfred, Upayavira, Carsten and myself are here for now. On the next table are among others David (all the way from Gouldburn, Australia) and Jeremias (all the way from Luzern, a bit closer).
