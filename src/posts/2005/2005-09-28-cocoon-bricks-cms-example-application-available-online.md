I've just posted the following [message](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=112789717522940&w=2) to the Cocoon mailing lists, testers are most welcome, see the [BricksCms wiki page](http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/BricksCms) for up-to-date information!

_Hi community,

I'm preparing the bricks-cms example application for the GetTogether next week, a first version is available in the whiteboard.

See http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/BricksCms .

Testers are welcome - although there's not much to test at the application level, if people could try to build and run the app in various environments it would be really appreciated!

If someone finds time to test it, please report your findings here or on the wiki page, or send patches, or commit your fixes, whatever's most appropriate.

Note that my GT talk contains the words "best practices" in the title...but the first slide will say "there are no best practices": there is more than one way of doing things in Cocoon!

The bricks-cms currently shows my way of building apps, but there are many other valid ways, and of course I'm open to suggestions!

I've been using a similar app skeleton to explain Cocoon to several of my customers over the last year, and they've liked it. Hopefully it will help people get a better overview of what Cocoon is.

Hope to see many of you at the GetTogether, registration is still open at http://www.cocoongt.org/ !
