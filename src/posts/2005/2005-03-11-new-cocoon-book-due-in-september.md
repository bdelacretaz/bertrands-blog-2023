Reinhard Poetz [announces](http://www.poetz.cc/weblog/4) his new [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org) book (together with [Alexander Schatten](http://www.schatten.info/index.html)), due in September.

The book's going to be in german, but it's still very good news for the Cocoon community, as the platform is certainly gaining in popularity in German-speaking places. This can only help!

I'm happy to see Reinhard's project going forward, as we talked briefly about it a while ago, and you never know what happens to book projects ;-)
