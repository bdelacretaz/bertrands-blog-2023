Did [Stefano](http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/) (who by the way [owns his first name](http://www.google.ch/search?q=stefano) on Google) think that we wouldn't know [what to talk about](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112811752100002&r=1&w=2) at the [Cocoon GT](http://www.cocoongt.org/) later this week?
