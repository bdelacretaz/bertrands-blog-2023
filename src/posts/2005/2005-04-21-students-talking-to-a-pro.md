![sylvain-wallez-ichat.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/sylvain-wallez-ichat.jpg)Thanks [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/) for your time! The videoconference with my students was a success and I'm sure your wise words have been well received.

Videoconference is so easy today (assuming you're the boss of the firewall admin ;-), we should use it more often to put our students in contact with active professionals, to help them think _out of the school box_.
