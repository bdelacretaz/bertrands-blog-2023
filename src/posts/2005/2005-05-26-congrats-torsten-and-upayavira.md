And to [all others](http://ken.coar.org/burrow/index.html?entry=1484;comments=true) who've been elected as members of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org/foundation) during today's members meeting.

Although it was hard for me to decide who _not_ to vote for in the Board election (as there were more candidates than slots), the composition of the [new Board](http://ken.coar.org/burrow/index.html?entry=1484;comments=true) looks really good to me.

Given with the recent (mostly) constructive discussions among members on the evolution of the Foundation, the future looks exciting.
