The live Cocoon 2.1.7 demo at [http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/](http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/) works now, it had been running half-broken for a while but I have fixed it, with [Vadim](http://blog.reverycodes.com/)'s help.

This is a great way of learning about Cocoon without even having to install it. Enjoy!
