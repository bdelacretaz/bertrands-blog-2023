Bern's _Berner Zeitung_ publishes an interview with [Stefano Mazzocchi](http://www.espace.ch/artikel_67731.html) done during an open source conference which took place in Bern recently (writing [LOTS](http://www.lots.ch) would of course be easier but I'm trying to avoid boring my readers with it. Does it work?).

The interview is in german but a [translation to english](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.espace.ch%2Fartikel_67731.html&langpair=de%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools) by Google is suprisingly readable. Except they translate MIT to WITH - makes sense litterally, but not very semantic as a translation ;-)
