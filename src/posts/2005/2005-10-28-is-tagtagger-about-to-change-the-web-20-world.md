[Matthew](http://www.silentpenguin.com/archives/2005/10/cashing_in_on_w.html) wants to be part of the next Web 2.0 revolution with [tagtagger](http://www.tagtagger.com/).

Well, I never thought of that, but tagging your tags will definitely make a difference in our 21st century lives. It's _Web 2.0 squared_ actually, wow!

And the possible variations are endless: I'm sure tagtagger will have many friends soon, maybe blogblogger, bugbugger, docsdocccer...hypehyper, maybe ;-)

Recursion is always fun, maybe even more so in Web 2.0...
