Shame on me, I have forgotten to make the required noise about the emergence of a french-speaking [Cocoon online community](http://cocoon.apache.org/fr/).

[Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/archives/000160.html) suggested it as a way to reach people who do not feel comfortable enough with english to use the english-speaking lists.

We'll see how this works out before (maybe) creating lists in other languages. We'll keep an eye on the [stats](http://www.apache.org/~coar/mlists.html#cocoon.apache.org), as of today there are 77 subscribers, not bad.

_Update: I have removed the c cedilla in the title of this post, which caused an HTML &ccedil; entity to appear in my RSS feed (but in CDATA so the feed still validates). I should have a look at this, thanks to Stephane Bailliez for the notice!_
