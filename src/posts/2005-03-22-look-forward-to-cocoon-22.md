As the 2.1.7 release is near, [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/) writes about the [Cocoon 2.2 goodies](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/archives/000171.html). Not _planned_ stuff, all this is already available in the code repository, even if not everything is tested or polished yet.

It's amazing to see that, even though the so-much-talked-about Real Blocks are not here yet, keeping them as a distant vision has helped several great ideas to pop up. Most of the new features can be seen as small things, but taken together they will make it much easier to write and debug [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org) applications.

Although I guess 2.1.7 will be the stable release for some time, the new features in 2.2 (for which no release date has been set yet) might prompt many people to switch quickly, and it looks like the backwards compatibility will be very good.
