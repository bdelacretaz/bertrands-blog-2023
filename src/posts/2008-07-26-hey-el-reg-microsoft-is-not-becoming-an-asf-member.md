Contrary to what [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/25/microsoft_gpl/) reports, Microsoft is not _paying $100,000 annual membership_ to the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org).

ASF membership cannot be bought: _people_ earn their individual membership by [merit](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html), and there's no such thing as ASF member companies.

As with any other [sponsor of the ASF](http://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html), Microsoft's [sponsorship](http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html) only means that they're giving money to the ASF, money that the ASF can use freely, as the ASF does not accept directed donations.

I am very pleased to see [this](http://port25.technet.com/archive/2008/07/25/oscon2008.aspx) happening. It won't make me love Microsoft's current products much more (although, as my son notes, the XBox is a nifty piece of kit), but it is great to see more and more people inside Microsoft understand the importance of open source in today's IT landscape.

_Update: as I write this, the Google Number for [+apache +microsoft +sponsor\*](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2Bapache+%2Bmicrosoft+%2Bsponsor*&btnG=Search) is 682,000_

_Update: it's been at least 24 hours since I posted a comment to the Register article linked above, indicating their error. Surprisingly, that comment hasn't been moderated in yet..._
