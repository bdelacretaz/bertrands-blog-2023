I'm sitting in the _state of the ASF_ session at ApacheCon, and Noel Bergman is giving us the facts about the [ASF incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/).

- There now 33 projects in the Incubator
- 23 of them have graduated
- 4 are "retired", they didn't make it
- The Incubator PMC is the second largest in the ASF, with 47 members, and more pending

The incubation process is explained on the [incubator website](http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Process_Description.html).
