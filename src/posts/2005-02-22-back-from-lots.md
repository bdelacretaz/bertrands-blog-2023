I hope to find time for a longer report later, but right now I'd like to say big THANKS to all who contributed to make [this](http://www.lots.ch) a great event.

Once again, it was way cool to have people from different projects and "tribes" get together in Bern. For me it's the key point: LOTS is not a _Linux Event_ nor an _Apache Event_ or a _Mozilla event_, it's about free and open source software _at large_.

I made new friends, and stronger ties with others. Listened to enlightening and new-avenues-opening talks. Had fun.

/me happy.
