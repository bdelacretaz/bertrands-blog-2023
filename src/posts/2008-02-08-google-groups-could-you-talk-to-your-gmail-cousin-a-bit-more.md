Even though Gmail [bothers us](http://vafer.org/blog/20060502022752) with its _Sender_ header, Google Groups's set of virtual gray matter is apparently too small to figure out that

```

From: "Bertrand Delacretaz" <myself@somewhere.ch>
Sender: myself@gmail.com
```

comes from _myself@gmail.com_.

Can't those guys talk together?
