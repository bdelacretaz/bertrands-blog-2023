Fascinating post by [Robert Cringely](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051117.html) about what Google could do with all the dark fiber they've been buying: how about deploying 300 or more "portable" (if you have a truck handy that is) container-based data centers around the Net and interconnecting them via a fast private network?

Anyone wanna buy some Akamai shares for cheap?

An Internet That Works built by Google could be great news as long as they stick to their _Don't be Evil_ motto. But having so much power in the hands of a single global company is also a bit worrying...

I'm all excited about the future that Cringely sees, but let's hope some decent competition remains. I wouldn't want the world of consumer computing to just move from one monopoly to another.
