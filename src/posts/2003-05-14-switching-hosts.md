[Torsten](http://blog.vafer.org/index.php?itemid=21) is looking for a new .org home.

I'm also switching providers, from [dsvr](http://dsvr.co.uk), where service was good but disk space too expensive, to [onSmart](http://onsmart.com) who have some good virtual server packages, including root access for a decent price.

After having to fight regularly with the almost-root account at dsvr to get my stuff installed, it is good to have full access again. I tested onSmart's service before ordering, by asking some fairly technical questions about their service, and got quick and accurate answers which is a good sign.

I haven't moved everything to onSmart yet, but we have already some services in daily use there and everything looks solid.
