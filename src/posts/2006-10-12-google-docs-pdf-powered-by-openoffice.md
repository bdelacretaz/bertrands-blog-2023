Funny...a PDF exported from [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) says

PDF Producer: OpenOffice.org 2.0

I was hoping they'd use [FOP](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop) - but at least it looks like they aren't reinventing the wheel.

It'd be interesting to check if they're using OpenOffice to generate other formats as well.
