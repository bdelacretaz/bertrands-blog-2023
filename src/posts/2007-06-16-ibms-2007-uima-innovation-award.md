IBM just announced its [2007 UIMA Innovation Award](http://www-304.ibm.com/jct09002c/university/scholars/ur/awards/eclipse/uima_awards.html). to encourage college or university faculty members in working on this _Unstructured Information Management Architecture_.

Several [ASF](http://apache.org) projects are mentioned in the description, including (obviously) the incubating [Apache UIMA](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/uima.html), but also [Jackrabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org) and [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org). They forgot [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr), but if something happens in Lucene it should trickle down to Solr eventually.

The scope of UIMA is not entirely clear to me, but as I understand it is meant to be a framework to plugin unstructured information extraction tools, for natural language processing for example.

Making sense of unstructured information is a huge topic now in press and news circles, so it's good to see such efforts associated with Apache projects!

In a much more modest sense, [Tika](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/tika.html) is also a small step towards making sense of our masses of data, and recent [discussions](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.tika.devel) show that momentum is also building up there.
