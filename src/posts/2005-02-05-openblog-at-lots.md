Thanks to [bitflux](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/lots-bitflux-ch-openblog-during-lots.html) and our own [delicate](http://delicate.ch/), we're going to try an [open blog](http://lots.bitflux.ch/) during [LOTS 2005](http://www.lots.ch/).

People will be able to post freely on the blog, as long as they're inside the conference building (or their IP is, more precisely).

It will be interesting to see what comes out of this. At best, real-time feedback on the stuff. At worst...well, we'll quickly turn it off it goes out of hand! But I'm looking forward to the experiment.
