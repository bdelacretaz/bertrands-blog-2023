This blog moved again, to a new setup based on the
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator and using
Matt DeCamp's [eleventonia](https://github.com/mattdecamp/eleventonia)
starter project for the theme.

I've done my best to transfer all the content, including images
and files, but if you see something missing please let me know!

I _did_ dig out some missing images from a very old
[Movable Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type)
archive of the first version of this blog, the content of which has been
kept (mostly) intact over the years!

The magic of the _real_
Web is being able to move content over three platforms, losing
almost nothing and with very reasonable effort. Run away from
people who tell you otherwise.

I haven't "ported" the comments however, as nowadays commenting
happens elsewhere and I didn't feel the need to install a specific
commenting service.

The homepage has the _complete_ list of posts, close to a thousand
of them, starting back in 2002. Looks like I missed the opportunity
to celebrate my twenty years of blogging last year!
