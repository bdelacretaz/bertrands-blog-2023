Looking for a good explanation of why people should use "reply to" to avoid breaking mailing lists threads when replying.  
I didn't find what I was looking for, but here are some good "mailing lists netiquette" links:  

* [Apache Jakarta Project - mailing lists guildelines](http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html)   
* [Howard Rheingold - The Art of Hosting Good Conversations Online](http://www.rheingold.com/texts/artonlinehost.html)  

Does anyone have a good explanation or reference about the "reply-to" thing? I'd like to add it here.  

_Update_: after questioning a mailing list user who sends messages without the required _in-reply-to_ header, it seems like some versions of the Outlook mail client do not handle this header properly.  
Cool. Now I have two nicknames for Outlook, _virus pipeline_ and _thread killer_ :-)
