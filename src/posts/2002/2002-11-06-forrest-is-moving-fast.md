There is a lot of excitement and action these days around the [Forrest](http://xml.apache.org/forrest) project. We might have a really cool XML-based documentation system soon!

There seem to be more sites published with Forrest daily: [Apache XML project](http://xml.apache.org) [Apache FOP project](http://xml.apache.org/fop) [David Crossley's homepage](http://cvs.apache.org/%7Ecrossley/) [Anteater website](http://aft.sourceforge.net/)
