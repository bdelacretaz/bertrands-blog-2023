I try to avoid following news about the _SCO vs. everybody_ saga as I find it to be mostly a waste of time between arguments, counterarguments, smoke and mirrors.

[This report](http://linuxjournal.com/print.php?sid=6956), however, caught my attention. The author has been actually visiting SCO under a very strict NDA and gives an interesting analysis on what he saw. It looks like the stolen code might have been stolen mostly from old textbooks...
