[![ghoplogosm.jpg](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/ghoplogosm.jpg)](http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/)The [Google Highly Open Participation Contest](http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/) just went live.

With this program, somewhat similar to the [Google Summer Of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/), high school students all over the world can help open source projects, and get rewards for doing so.

There are lots of fun tasks in the [ASF](http://www.apache.org)'s list of [tasks](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-asf/issues/list), like designing logos, presenting the ASF to your community, finding bad spots in our documentations, creating screencasts and more.

Make sure to have a look and to recommend the program to students around you! This initial edition is an experiment for everybody involved, we're eager to see what comes out of it.
