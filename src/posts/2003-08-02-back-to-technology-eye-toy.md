I'm glad to see that [Carsten](http://radio.weblogs.com/0107211/2003/07/28.html#a141) also enjoys _technical silence_. It was good to forget about everything (except good friends, great night skies and naps in the hammock) for some time!

But today technology is back with a vengeance with the [Playstation Eye Toy](http://www.thunderbolt.be/reviews/viewreview.php?rid=278) that my son bought this morning (after carefully saving his vacation allowance ;-)

This thing is just amazing: no camera training required, just put yourself in front of the camera in the suggested position and start playing. Lots of fun, and makes me think about lots of non-game applications. Parallels with [Ray Kurzweil](http://www.kurzweiltech.com/aboutray.html)'s writings are obvious, and after reading another William Gibson [book](http://www.salon.com/books/review/1999/10/29/gibson/) on vacation I'm almost starting to shiver at the sight of this...
