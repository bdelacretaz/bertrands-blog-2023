Good news! Via [Chregu](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/2005/11/29/skypein-available-in-switzerland.html) and [namics weblog](http://blog.namics.com/2005/11/skypein_in_der.html), official info at [Skype](http://www.skype.com/products/skypein/).

This means being reachable on your laptop everywhere from a "normal" phone number, and from what I've heard they have decent voice mail as well. I don't think I'll publish my number, but rather reroute from my main office number, to be "transparently" reachable as needed.

This will be much cheaper with a Swiss SkypeIn number than via a mobile phone, which are still fairly expensive here. And it's easier to turn off the non-urgent business calls when needed.
