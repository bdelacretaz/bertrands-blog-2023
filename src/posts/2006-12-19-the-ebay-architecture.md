[Ugo](http://agylen.com/2006/12/19/the-ebay-architecture/) points to the [slides](http://www.addsimplicity.com/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf) of a recent SAMSIG [presentation](http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=2013&mo=11&yr=2006) on eBay's architecture. A fascinating read...and it's comforting to learn that they threw away most of J2EE: _eBay scales on servlets and a rewritten connection pool_.
