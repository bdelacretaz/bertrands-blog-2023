Today school kids around here can take the day off to go to work with their parents or someone else. The day is called "oser tous les m√©tiers" in french, which about translates to this post's title.

The idea is for them to get a feel of what the "professional world" is, and maybe get to know their future job.

My oldest daughter is coming with me at the office, I have prepared a trial version of Flash so that she can go over the tutorials. She's finishing school soon, meaning to be a graphic artist or multimedia designer.

But I guess the most exciting part for her will be to feel the atmosphere and people at work. Dear colleagues, please don't be too weird today ;-)

More info (in french) about the days' concept [here](http://www.egalite.vd.ch/PROD/wss/befh_wss_p.nsf/key/frameset?Open&theme=actualites&cat=aucune&pdoc=a_osez_metiers). A perfect example of a crappy URL by the way.
