I haven't published here in a while, but I've been writing and presenting elsewhere:

<!-- excerpt -->

- Coordinating the [Adobe Tech Radar](https://medium.com/tag/adobe-tech-radar/archive) as its Lead Editor.
- Writing [on Medium](https://medium.com/@bdelacretaz) from time to time.
- Presenting at a number of conferences, in English and French, see the list in [my pressbook](https://pinboard.in/u:bdelacretaz/t:pressbook/).

My [biography](https://grep.codeconsult.ch/about-me/) on this blog is mostly current, please have a look if you need more info!

A personal blog is less relevant for me today, I hope you enjoy those other channels.
