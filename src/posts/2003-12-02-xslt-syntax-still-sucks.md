This hasn't changed since [last time](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000157.html) but it is being discussed [again](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-users&m=107035742731713&w=2) on the Cocoon users mailing list, so I collected some more links:

[XSLScript](http://www.pault.com/XSLScript/) looks much cooler than plain XSLT to write, but it doesn't seem to be widely used.

Here's a [discussion](http://www.biglist.com/lists/xsl-list/archives/200210/msg00442.html) among famous people about an abbreviated syntax for XSLT.

[Linus](http://bitmover.com/pipermail/lmbench-users/2003-November/000076.html) has some opinions as well.

_Update: [Antonio](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-users&m=107044758825204&w=2) asks for more advice on [xsl-list](http://www.biglist.com/lists/xsl-list/archives/200312/msg00071.html). The replies roughly range from "ignore Linus" to "maybe people have been using the XML hammer for too many nails", with an interesting sidetrack on "to swear or not to swear"._

_Update: Oleg Dulin adds a few [thoughts](http://www.olegdulin.com/index.php?p=53&c=1) on his weblog._
