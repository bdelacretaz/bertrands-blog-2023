We had a great [NoSQL meeting](http://www.nosqloakland.org/) yesterday evening colocated with [ApacheCon](http://us.apachecon.com). Thanks Jukka for organizing!

I was in track B for the second part, and found it very interesting to compare three different approaches to non-relational content storage: MarkLogic server, JCR and Pier Fumagalli's Lucene+DAV technique.

I also quite liked Steve Yen's ["horseless carriage"](http://blog.northscale.com/northscale-blog/2009/11/attending-nosql-oakland-2009.html) way of looking at NoSQL. Defining things by what they are, as opposed to what they are not, sounds like a good idea.

I gave a short talk about JCR, find the slides below. Of course, as usual, they're not as good as when I'm here to talk about them ;-)
