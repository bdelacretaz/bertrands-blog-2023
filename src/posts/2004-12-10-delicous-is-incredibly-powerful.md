Why did I wait so long?

My [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/bdelacretaz) account has already helped me find a lot of intersting stuff on the web (including a cool [paper](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/sleep.htm) on sleep, like _how to get enough sleep when you find so much interesting stuff on the web_).

The thing is, you find so much stuff by _looking at what else interests people who are interested in the same things than you_. It's the same in a classroom, where you benefit a lot from the questions asked by others. They have the same interests as you, but slightly different concerns which open up your horizon.

Sharing link tags (the _and X other people_ annotations on del.icio.us) enables just this.

Great tool, don't wait to [get yours](http://del.icio.us/)!
