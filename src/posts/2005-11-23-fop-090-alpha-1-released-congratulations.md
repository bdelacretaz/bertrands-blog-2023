The [Apache FOP](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) team just announced the availability of FOP 0.90 alpha 1, see the official announcement on the FOP mailing list.

This is a _very_ important announcement for FOP, because it is the first release of a redesign which started a long time ago. So I hope the FOP people will be able to throw the big party that they deserve after this very important milestone.

An extensive list of supported features (including comparison with the mainstream 0.20.5 release) is available on the [FOP compliance page](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/compliance.html).

Kudos to the people who hanged in tight over the years to make this happen: it's been a long and bumpy ride, but persistence pays! I'm thinking mostly of [Jeremias](http://www.jeremias-maerki.ch/) because I know him personally, but the whole team has shown that they're back on track, and this is great news!

On a sidenote, this release includes decent RTF support, comparable or better to what was in [jfor](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfor/). So it looks like we'll be able to declare the jfor project officially integrated into FOP, this is also great news! I've not been following closely as I have no need for RTF in my current projects, but it's good to see that people are still working on and using this.

Congratulations to the FOP team, you guys rock!
