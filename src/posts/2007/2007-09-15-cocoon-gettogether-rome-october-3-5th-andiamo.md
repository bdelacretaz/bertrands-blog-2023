[![cocoon_gt_2007_125x125.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/cocoon_gt_2007_125x125.jpg)](http://www.cocoongt.org/)So the [bytes have aligned](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000798.html) and I'll be at the [GT](http://www.cocoongt.org) for the conference day (Friday October 5th), talking about...something: the final talk selection is coming soon.

Stay tuned, and [register](http://www.cocoongt.org/Registration.html) early to secure your seat and show your support for this year's enthusiastic Italian organizers!

As the GT seems to have something to do with elephants this year (more about this in due time), I'd suggest Maceo Parker's hilarious [elephant stepped on my foot](http://www.maceo.fr/index.php?action=glossaire&subaction=mot&numero=3) song ([mp3 excerpt](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/maceo-elephant-excerpt.mp3)) as the Official GT 2007 Song.

_Update: the [conference day program](http://www.cocoongt.org/PROGRAM.html) is out._
