![bbq-stuff.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/bbq-stuff.jpg)Not yet at least: today is Barbecue Sauce Refill Day here: I started doing my own a few months ago, and tomorrow we're meeting a [world-class expert](http://kemppro.com/), so I'm eager to have his opinion!

As said expert is (mostly) mute about what he puts in his sauce, I'm based my own on the Arkansas recipe, with some personal variations.

When you start coooking it, a smell so strong as to be almost unbearable is a good indication of success, and it's the case right now, so I'm looking forward to the result ;-)

## Arkansas bbq sauce (2 gallons)

* 2 quarts 	Water
* 1½ cup 	Brown sugar
* 1½ cup 	Worcestershire sauce
* 1½ cup 	Yellow mustard
* 1 quart 	Catsup
* ½ cup 	Black pepper
* ½ cup 	Dried red pepper flakes
* 3 quarts 	Red wine vinegar
* 1 quart 	White wine
* 1½ cup 	Salt

Bring to boil and then simmer for about ½ hour.

Do not cook or store in aluminum, store in glass.
