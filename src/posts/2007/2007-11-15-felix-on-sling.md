![felix-on-sling.jpg](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/felix-on-sling.jpg)Yesterday night's BOF was a good opportunity to make more people aware of the nice things in [Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling), and now Felix is on stage talking about it as part of the [Fast Feather Track](http://us.apachecon.com/us2007/program/Fast_Feather).

Fifteen minutes is a very short time to present your project, but still, the Fast Feather Track is a great opportunity for new projects and speakers to bring their contributions to ApacheCon.

Note that Felix is also a committer on [Felix](http://felix.apache.org). Recursive committership maybe? I've heard the [httpd](http://httpd.apache.org) guys are jealous...but it's hard to find someone named _httpd_ to be a committer I guess.
