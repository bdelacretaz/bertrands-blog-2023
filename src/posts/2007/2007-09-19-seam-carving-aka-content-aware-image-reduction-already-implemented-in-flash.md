[![seam-carving.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/seam-carving.jpg)](http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/)I didn't expect implementations of [Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir's image resizing method](http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/) (mentioned by [Sylvain](http://bluxte.net/blog/2007-08/30-57-12.html) a while ago) to be available so quickly, but [Quasimondo](http://www.quasimondo.com/archives/000651.php) points to no less than _four_ Flash implementations.

[Patrick Swieskowski](http://swieskowski.net/carve/)'s demo, for example, allows you to play with your own images - very impressive.

Sounds like this will be part of our toolbox sooner than expected. Geniuses at work, indeed.
