The big thing about the iPhone is obviously the multi-touch interface, and we're going to see more of that in the future, for sure!

Have a look at this [demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKh1Rv0PlOQ&eurl=) by [Jeff Han](http://cs.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirtouch/), it's easy to envision _some_ applications for this stuff.

_Update: Adam L. Penenberg has written an interesting [article](http://www.fastcompany.com/subscr/112/open_features-canttouchthis.html) on Jeff Han at fastcompany.com, with a link to another [cool demo video](http://fastcompany.com/video/general/perceptivepixel.html)_.
