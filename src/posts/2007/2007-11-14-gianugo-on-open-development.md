I'm sitting in Gianugo's talk on [Open Development](http://www.open-development.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Main/WebHome) and he's brilliant as usual - despite the jet lag.

To simplify (a lot), he thinks Open Source is only _a distribution method for software_ - more is needed to ensure that development happens in an actually open way. The [examples page](http://www.open-development.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Main/ExamplesWhatOpenDevelopmentMightBe) points to how some organizations achieve that.
