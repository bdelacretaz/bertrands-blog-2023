Hey SCO, how come nobody told you that attacking the Linux world with junk claims was [not a good idea](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070914/laf040.html?.v=101)? Or maybe you weren't listening?

I have worked a lot with SCO systems in the early nineties, and at the times this was a great Unix clone for PCs...the SCO of today feels like a much different company. Too bad, but it feels like they get what they asked for.
