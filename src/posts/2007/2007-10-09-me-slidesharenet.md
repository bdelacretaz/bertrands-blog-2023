[![slideshare-stuff.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/slideshare-stuff.jpg)](http://www.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz)[Lars](http://weblogs.goshaky.com/weblogs/lars/) recently reminded us of SlideShare, so I have added [more of my stuff](http://www.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz) there.

He's is right that this is a very convenient service - a bit slow maybe, but I guess their load is growing.

Slides from the [Cocoon GT 2007](http://www.slideshare.net/group/cocoon) are also available there.
