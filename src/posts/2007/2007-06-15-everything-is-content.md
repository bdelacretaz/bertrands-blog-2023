[![david-nuescheler-tss-video-shots.jpg](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/david-nuescheler-tss-video-shots.jpg)](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=45763)If your applications have to do with content (and they do - read on), you shouldn't miss TSS's video interview of [David Nuescheler](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=45763), the [JSR-170](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170) and [JSR 283](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283) spec lead.

David explains his _everything is content_ mantra, and the more I work with [this technology](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/), the more I agree.

We've been working on a dead simple javascript-based interface to JSR-170 lately, that will make content repositories much easier to access. [Stay tuned](http://jazoon.com/en/conference/presentationdetails.html?type=sid&detail=401)!

And by the way, David is also CTO of [a cool company](http://www.day.com/) that I'm kinda [related with](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000769.html). We are looking for talented people, see you [there](http://www.day.com/site/en/index/jobs.html) maybe?
