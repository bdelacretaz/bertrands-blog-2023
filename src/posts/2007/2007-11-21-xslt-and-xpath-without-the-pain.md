Here are my slides from last week's [ApacheCon](http://www.us.apachecon.com).

They are not really standalone: you might need me to make sense of them ;-)

 "XSLT - without the pain!"

The talk went well, including some challenging questions and feedback, which is cool.

Someone with a strong background in rules-based languages came up to talk, and made me realize that my talk is really targeted at people who come from a procedural language background. People who know Prolog or a related language have an easier time moving to XSLT that those who come from Java or C, so my "avoid procedural constructs" line doesn't really apply to them.
