Last Friday, our [very own](http://apache.org/foundation/board/) Greg Stein was mugged, for a grand total of one credit card and hundred dollars, according to Kevin Burton who's got [all the details](http://feedblog.org/2007/08/27/greg-stein-director-of-the-apache-software-foundation-was-mugged-accepting-donations/).

Kevin has setup a fund to send Greg to _a resort in Big Sur for a week or two where he can just relax and get better_ when this is over. Use the PayPal buttons below to contribute to the _Greg Stein Fund_ on PayPal, and show your sympathy for someone who's done _a lot_ for Open Source and especially for the Apache Software Foundation.

This is real - Greg just confirmed by private email that he's "alive but not feeling well at all". Get well soon, Greg!

_Update: the donation fund has been a [complete success](http://feedblog.org/2007/08/29/greg-stein-fund-a-complete-success/) and is now closed, thanks to everybody who participated! Direct donations [to the ASF](http://apache.org/foundation/contributing.html#Paypal), of course, are still accepted ;-)_
