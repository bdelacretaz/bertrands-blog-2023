The book contains tons of practical advice and examples which help a lot in making sense of [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) in one's daily (programming) life.

I'm not through yet, but everything I read until now has helped in my quest to make the systems I'm working on more RESTful. Time will tell if I succedd in this...
