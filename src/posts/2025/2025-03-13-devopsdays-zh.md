I had the pleasure of giving my talk on
_the Power of Simplicity, Crafting durable software systems_ at 
[DevOpsDays Zürich 2025](https://www.devopsdays.ch/) today (in Winterthur - of course), 
and enjoyed it very much.

It was my first time at a [devopsdays conference](https://devopsdays.org/), and I enjoyed 
a number of nice touches that I haven't seen elsewhere. Maybe I haven't been to enough
conferences, but all of this was new to me:

- The use of a [Catchbox](https://catchbox.com/) style microphone for audience questions, very effective and adds a bit of fun to the "next question" phase.
- Active monitoring of the CO2 footprint caused by travelling to the conference, with actual reductions over time, very nice!
- Recommending that people "do the Pac-Man" when assembling in circles to talk, leaving a small gap in their formation (like the "mouth" of Pac-Man) to signal to others that they are welcome to join the conversation.

I got a Lego Bonsai Tree box as a speaker present, which is very nice, and fun as
I am speaking about playing Lego just with basic bricks in my talk. That box is quite nice indeed.

All in all, a great conference with a great vibe and great content. Thank you very much for the 
organizers for selecting my talk and for the flawless organization.

The slides of my talk are available below, and I will link to the recording once it's available.
If you understand French or trust a machine translation, recordings of the same talk in French
are available in my [pressbook](/pressbook).
