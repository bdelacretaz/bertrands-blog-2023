I like [Simon St.Laurent](http://www.simonstl.com/)'s [view](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3191) on XML allowing _improvisation in data structures_. Thinking about it, that's what I've been doing all the time, writing XML example documents first and DTDs or schemas later on (if needed).

I also like improvisation in music: playing something unprepared with a group of people that you trust to react fast enough when something happens, to steer the "project" in the right direction. Lots of parallels here.
