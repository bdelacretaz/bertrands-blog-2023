[Simon Willison](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/12/23/wikilove) reflects on the power of [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/), including a nice list of related links. These guys _have_ been busy!

The [Wikitex](http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex) stuff is amazing, including great looking [music](http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex#Music).

If someone tells you that [collaborative projects don't work](http://www.jimjag.com/imo/index.php?/archives/7-The-Force-of-FUD.html), send them there!

Watching the [live recent changes](http://kohl.wikimedia.org/cgi-bin/rcdumper) page is amazing - this thing is alive...
