Nothing serious, but this is very rare in this area: we just felt an earthquake here in Lausanne, and folks 10 km away felt it as well. Just one pulse, but definitely here.

Reminds me of scary nights in Los Angeles - this is nothing like the ones we felt over there, but still, the feeling of being unable to do anything about it is exactly the same.

_Update: turns out this was a Richter 5 quake centered in Besan√ßon, in nearby France. It's been felt all around this part of Switzerland, but apparently caused no damage. More news (in french) [here](http://www.swissinfo.org/sfr/swissinfo.html?siteSect=113&sid=4740763&ticker=true)_.
