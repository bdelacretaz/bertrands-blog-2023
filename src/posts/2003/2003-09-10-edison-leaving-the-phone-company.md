From the _slightly scary_ desk: Bill Joy (the "Edison of the Internet" according to Fortune mag) is [leaving](http://www.itworld.com/Tech/4535/030909joy/) [Sun](http://www.ktvu.com/technology/2466595/detail.html).

Joy says that the time is right for him to _move on to different challenges_.

For now it is not known what he's going to do, but I'd feel better if he was going back to farming or herding sheep - if the _different challenges_ are in another computer tech company, this would give me another bad impression of Sun.
