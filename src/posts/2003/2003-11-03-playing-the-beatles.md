This week I'm playing drums in the evenings for a [Village Players](http://www.villageplayers.ch/Beatles.html) show about the Fab Four, called _the Beatles...from me to you_.

Although I've been listening a lot to the Beatles when I was younger, I've never actually played their music before, and it is challenging. Although the music that's been chosen is simple technically, it is really hard to get the right feel and groove, very laid back yet energetic. But we're getting there I think, thanks to a cast of fine musicians.

The hardest thing is getting rid of these catchy melodies after the show - my favorite songs tend to stick in my head and keep playing for hours once the show is over!
