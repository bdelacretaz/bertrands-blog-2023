Tom Coates' new weblog is about _creative ways to manage online communities and user-generated content_ - definitely one for my blogroll.

I found his definition of the [four types of moderation](http://www.everythinginmoderation.org/2003/10/) particularly interesting - having such precise definitions might come handy in selling "open collaboration tools" to management types.
