Vacation, two weeks work, vacation again. Sounds like a nice routine ;-)

Still no gadgets on holidays, but this time I'm taking a computer book with me (along with Asimov and Philip K.Dick) which is unusual for me. Need to know more about JBoss and particularly JMX.

As they say: _talk among yourselves_. I'll be back soon.
