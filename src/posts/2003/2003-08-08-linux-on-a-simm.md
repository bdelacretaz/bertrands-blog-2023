Although I don't work much with embedded systems these days, I'm watching Linux systems (as opposed to specialized embedded OSes) become smaller every year. The [ucSimm](http://www.uclinux.org/ucsimm/) project is very interesting in this respect: a full-blown computer with Linux and Ethernet in the shape of a SIMM board. Cool!
