If you don't find me online in the next few days I'm going to be skiing at the [Pearl of the Alps](http://www.saas-fee.ch/index-e.htm). All electronic devices stay at home, except my old trusty GSM phone that only does voice, SMS, and POP3 mail if you really insist. I won't insist, I like low-tech holidays.  
A friend of mine was there recently and they had minus twenty-five Celsius. What was this global warming thing again?
