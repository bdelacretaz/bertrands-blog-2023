While Matthew Langham sees companies running to [get onboard](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3234) the Open-Source boat, it is sad to see Sun trying to [fight JBoss](http://www.shiftat.com/blog/page/werner/20030527#sun_reaffirms_no_jboss_at) with whatever silly weapon they can find (via [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/000957.html)).

I like boats. I like sailboats even more. And I like it when the wind picks up...

_Update: the silly weapon thing seems to be even worse than I thought - the "fight JBoss" weblog entry linked above has been removed by his author. [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/000968.html) has some thoughts about it._
