Steven has [switched](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/001112.html) - congratulations!

Eight monts after my own [switch](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000017.html), I can't thing of any serious negative points. I'm waiting on [oqo](http://www.oqo.com/) or [Antelope](http://www.antelopetech.com/) to come up with actual products so that I can complete my mobile (and only) setup with a mini-PC for mobile cross-platform development.

Currently I use [VirtualPC](http://www.connectix.com/) (recently bought by you-know-who) when I need to test PC stuff while on the go. It is workable but fairly slow, which is understandable given the processor emulation that is required.
