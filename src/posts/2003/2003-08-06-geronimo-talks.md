Yesterday's [proposal](http://incubator.apache.org/mail/general/200308) (scroll down to _Proposal for an Apache J2EE server project_) causes lots of talk on the general@incubator.apache.org list. From "I want to be in it, pliiiize!" to "how about you guys eat JBoss while you're at it", but in any case this seems to be a hot subject.

[Matthew](http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001247.html) notices the striking similarity between the proposed list of commiters and the [Core Developers](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000070.html) team. Interesting or scary depending how much you currently depend on JBoss.

I'm not much familiar with the JBoss community but several people seem to be disappointed by it. Hey, not all communities can be as healthy as [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org) ;-)

_Update: [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/001077.html) has more info on the ASF/JCP thing, and there is some more info on Geronimo [here](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/geronimo.html)._
