Interesting exchange on cocoon-dev yesterday about various quotes from great people about simplicity.  
Starting with [Sylvain Wallez](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=104489577206019&w=2) asking about Stefano Mazzochi's new signature, _Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate \[William of Ockham\]_, we non-latinists find that it means _Pluralities should not be posited without necessity_. Food for thought...  

Sylvain [goes on](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=104489667407468&w=2) quoting St-Exup√©ry, _"Perfection is achieved not when there's nothing more to add, but when there's nothing left to remove"_, which I wrongly thought to be from Albert Einstein. Conal Tuhoy [cites Einstein](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=104491157229747&w=2) from memory, _"things should made as simple as possible, but no simpler"_.  
Then Stefano [mentions Blaise Pascal](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=104490076913680&w=2), _"I'm writing you this long letter because I lack the time of writing a shorter one"_.  
Do we see some unity of thought here? These guys had no mailing list and no blogs but they definitely agree that less is more in most cases....which means I'm going to stop this here.
