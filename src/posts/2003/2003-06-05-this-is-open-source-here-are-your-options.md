Quoting Jeremias Maerki on the
[fop-user](https://lists.apache.org/thread/hmmoc1hskswtotg3rqhpk6ohfk54xgw8)
mailing list, talking about some problem in FOP:

> If the work-around doesn't work for you, you have several options:
>
> * This is OpenSource, you can do it yourself.
> * This is OpenSource, you can wait until someone has free time and thinks this is fun to implement.
> * You can find/hire someone to do it for you.

Right on, Jeremias!
