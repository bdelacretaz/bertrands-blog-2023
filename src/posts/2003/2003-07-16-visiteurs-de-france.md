Thanks [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain/) and family for the visit! It is nice to meet fellow Cocooners and speak French for a change (and yes, there _was_ something on the table before the picture was taken ;-) ![cocooners-irl-sylvain-2003-07-15.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/cocooners-irl-sylvain-2003-07-15.jpg)

We _did_ talk a bit about _less is more_ and spent just enough time online for a [nice surprise](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=105828398620969&w=2). The Cocoon community is amazing in many ways, it seems to Just Work (tm).
