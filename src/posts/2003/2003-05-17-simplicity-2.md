Simplicity is always beautiful. [this](http://www.melly-bike.com/moto.htm) is the most beautiful and simple motorbike design I've seen in a long time.

Not necessarily easy to implement though - a simple final result often implies powerful tools.

For this particular bike they're talking about 160 HP for 140 kg. Scary. I'm going to stick to [old faithful](http://www.bikepics.com/pictures/034368/) for the time being! (the one you see on this last picture is not mine, I have the 1993 model).

_update: [Marc](http://radio.weblogs.com/0116284/2003/05/19.html#a117) is afraid about one burning one's ass on this thing. I should have mentioned that they're supposed to add some kind of seat and body to this thing ;-)_
