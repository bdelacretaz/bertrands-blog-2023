Found [this](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/fisheyemenu/fisheyemenu-demo.shtml) from a reference on [Jon Udell's blog](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/01/15.html#a573).  
Way cool! I've seen many "alternative menu systems" in the last few years but this one can be really useful when there is a lot of information to display.
