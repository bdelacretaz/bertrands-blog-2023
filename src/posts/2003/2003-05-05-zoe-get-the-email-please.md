Found [this article](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/10/07/udell.html) about [Zoë](http://guests.evectors.it/zoe/) from Jon Udell.

Every now and then I think I'm going to write something to archive my email and make it searchable, but it looks like I won't have to write it.

Haven't checked it out IRL yet, only on paper, but Zoë looks promising.
