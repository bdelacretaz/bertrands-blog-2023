We've been talking about an ApacheCon Europe some time ago with Apache folks, but I couldn't offer serious help due to the [big trip](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000338.html).

It looks we won't have a genuine ApacheCon Europe in 2004, but there are good news still: the OSCOM people are adding ApacheTracks to their [conference](http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/rfp.html) in Zurich at the end of September. A nice opportunity (before [LOTS 2005](http://lots.ch) that is ;-) for ASF people from around here to socialize and exchange experiences.

Great news! I'll be there for sure.

Note that I did relay a slightly misleading announcement here at first - this is _not_ an ApacheCon Europe as was previously announced.

_Update: looks like I was [not](http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001845.html) the only one to relay this info too quickly ;-)_
