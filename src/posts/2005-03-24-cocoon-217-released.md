Carsten [announces](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=111165425228965&w=2) release 2.1.7 (download it [here](http://cocoon.apache.org/mirror.cgi)) with many bugfixes and enhancements. Congratulations everybody, and thanks Carsten for the release work!

The focus of the community has definitely shifted to 2.2 now, my guess is that there will be one or two more minor releases of 2.1, but it looks like we're fairly close to an initial release of 2.2. Anyone can grab it from the subversion [repository](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cocoon/trunk/) already anyway, so have fun!
