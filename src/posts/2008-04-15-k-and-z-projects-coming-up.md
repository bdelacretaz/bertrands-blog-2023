In my [lightning talk](http://eu.apachecon.com/eu2008/program/Special%20Events) last week at ApacheCon, I presented the results of a scientific analysis to demonstrate that the [ASF](http://www.apache.org) needs a project with a name starting with K and another starting with Z.

Since then, I've been contacted by top executives from two projects which are about to spinoff the two missing groups. Multiple NDAs, including stone engravings on the Amsterdam pier, prevent me from giving more details here, but _stay tuned_.
