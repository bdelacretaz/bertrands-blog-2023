Discussions about whether we should use Artifical Intelligence helpers for creative work
remind me of musician's unions attempting to ban synthesizers and drum machines, back in the
early eighties, as told by the articles linked at the end of this post.

<!-- excerpt -->

Such a ban sounds funny today, we are _way_ past that fortunately. 


In the meantime, musicians have learnt to combine these tools with their own skills in fantastic ways,
covering the full range from "all electronics" to "no electronics" music, and everything in between,
for our enjoyment and at the service of their creativity.

We've come a long way, and it has taken time. 

I suppose our evolution regarding AI tools will be similar. We will learn where those make sense,
appreciate situations where we are fully separated from them, and use common sense and our
increasing experience to decide what the best tool for the job is.

Being a luddite is not my style, but I also want to embrace progress in a reasonable and durable
way. There will be mistakes along the way, but my optimistic self is confident that we will
collectively learn, as we do with any tool.

I'm looking forward to re-reading this post in a few years and
seeing how our use of generated content has evolved.

## P.S. Oh - this post uses an AI-generated image !

_Yes indeed. It feels a bit like cheating, exactly like using
a drum machine or synth does. Which I regularly do, at the 
service of a "larger picture" project._

_Our intern Antoine made me notice the weird arrangement of black
& white keys on the keyboard in the above image. You won't be
able to unsee it now, and I guess such artifacts are going to
be commonplace if we make use of more machine generated content.
That's fine with me, depending on the budget allocated to 
a specific piece of content and as long as that content
does its job._

_The main point where I think we need progress is in the energy
consumption of AI services. I was happy to read about 
[1.58 bits Large Language Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.17764)
recently, which perform well for a fraction of the energy cost, and
I'm confident we'll progress over time. We need to take our engineers
ethics seriously and keep the pressure so that such progress happens._

## P.P.S More AI: an AI-generated podcast of this page

_Update from January 31st 2025._

To complete the "AI as of early 2025" picture, I have asked Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) to
generate an audio podcast of this page. I am quite impressed by the
results, it makes sense and I find it reasonably enjoyable to listen to. Definitely useful for anyone who for some reason prefers getting this information in audio, assuming no hallucinations. I haven't heard
anything really wrong in the below result.
