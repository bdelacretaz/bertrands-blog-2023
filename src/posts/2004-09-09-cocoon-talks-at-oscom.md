Several Cocoon-related [talks](http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/program/) are on the agenda for the first day of [OSCOMÂ 4](http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/), including beginner's stuff (by yours truly), website management, Forms, Flow and Ugo's much expected (by me at least;-) Spring integration presentation.

Although Cocoon is not a CMS in itself, I see it becoming \*the\* framework on which many serious CMSish applications are built. It will be interesting to see how much interest our talks generate at OSCOM.

See you there!
