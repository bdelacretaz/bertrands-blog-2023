Picture this: you buy a (perfectly legal) machine M, buy some (perfectly legal) content C, and insert C in M for the purpose of playing it.

Content owner O doesn't want you to make too many copies of C (cause you're all supposed to be thieves, right?), so they have the bright idea of installing a piece of software S to control access to _your_ content C on _your_ machine M.

As they're shy about it, they install S in such a way that you cannot see it easily.

Now bring up more mud: S uses hacker-level covert techniques to hide itself _and_ is utterly broken, so that any clever pirate P can use it to install their own pirate software S' on your machine M.

And, last but not least, removing S breaks M...well, that's maybe not that bad as M was bound to be attacked in many ways via S, but still...M is supposed to be _your_ machine and _you_ paid for it right? Well, you even paid for C by the way...

The level of incompetence exposed in all this is hard to believe once you add _O = global media company_ into the equation. Analyses like [doxpara's](http://www.doxpara.com/?q=/node/1129) shows that Sony's rootkit has caused at least several hundred thousands of computers to become infected by their software S (or should it be S\*\*t?), and realistically much more than that.

My opinion of Sony was already fairly low after [previous](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000090.html) [experiences](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000055.html), and it's not getting any better.

This DRM junk shows that controlling software that's out in the wild is _hard_, and is a perfect example of causing more harm to legal customers than helping anybody.

I don't have an easy solution to the overall problem, but taking control of your customer's equipment using broken hacker software is...well, I'm not going to write that here ;-)
