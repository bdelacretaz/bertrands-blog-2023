For the second time in a row, I'm missing the [LIFT](http://liftconference.com) conference, due to collisions with teaching gigs that were planned way too early.

I guess I'll mark the dates in red for next year's conference as soon as they are published.

Too bad...especially as the [list of participants](http://liftconference.com/2007/people/participants) includes a lot of people that I'd haved loved to meet there. Next time.
