[vnunet.com](http://www.vnunet.com/News/1136433) (and many others) report on theÂ European Commission examining deployment of open source software in government departments.  
I think it's only a question of time before governments, schools and everybody get it. How much would they be able to save (after an inevitable transition phase) by moving from monopolistic to open software environments?  

Moving from proprietary data formats and programming languages to open standards will make all the difference. And Open Source is your best bet for open formats and languages, so it all fits together I think.  
Hey, even Microsoft gets it, with their announcements of XML as an alternate (for now) format for their Office software suite. We'll have to see what they mean by XML, however...
