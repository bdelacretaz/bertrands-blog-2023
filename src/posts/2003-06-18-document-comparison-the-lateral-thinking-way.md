Today we needed to compare PDF documents generated with two different software versions for identity. Not too many pages, about 60 maybe.

What do you do? Ask Google for a sophisticated document comparison utility? No way says [Roberto](http://www.link-u.com), just print both versions, superpose each page with the same page from the other version and look at them in front of a light source...

Technology is not always the answer ;-)
