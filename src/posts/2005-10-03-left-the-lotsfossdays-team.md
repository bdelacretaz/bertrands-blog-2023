I don't think there was an official announcement so here it is: I have left the [LOTS](http://www.lots.ch) / [fossdays](http://www.fossdays.org) team a few months ago, with regrets as helping to organize the LOTS 2005 conference was very interesting and rewarding, and the team was a cool one!

But one can only do so much in a day...and I was feeling like spreading myself too thin in the first half of this year. Hard choices...

_Update: A few days after posting this I learned that the remaining members of the LOTS association have decided to [close it down](http://www.fossdays.org/). I guess everybody is too busy to organize a new event as big as the last two, it's really LOTS of work ;-)_
