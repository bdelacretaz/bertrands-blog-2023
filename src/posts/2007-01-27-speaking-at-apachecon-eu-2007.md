![2007-europe-234x60.png](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/2007-europe-234x60.png)Two of my talks have been accepted, [Beyond Full-Text Searches with Solr and Lucene](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/program/talk/34), where I'll show how we use Solr to combine full-text and structured searches for powerful navigations, and [ XSLT and XPath - Without the Pain!](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/program/talk/84) where I'll explain how to learn and use XSLT in a painless and efficient way.

So I'll be there, looking forward to it! As usual, the [program](http://www.apachecon.com/2007/EU/html/sessions.html/) looks really good.
