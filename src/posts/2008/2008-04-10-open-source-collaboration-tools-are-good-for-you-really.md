Really? Well my [talk](http://eu.apachecon.com/eu2008/program/talk/2481) at ApacheCon is done and went well, so that's real at least.

 "Open Source tools are good for you!"

Someone commented that it was good and depressing at the same time. Their company has all the tools in place but doesn't get any added value, due to using them in the wrong way, or not consistently enough. Good to hear that my talk at least maps to real life ;-)

Moving from the [previous talk](http://grep.codeconsult.ch/2007/11/30/open-source-collaboration-tools-are-good-for-you/)'s bare metal approach to a higher level "what are the real issues that we're solving" approach was a good idea - people are aware of our tools today, we don't need to explain what they do as much as before.
