![dials.jpg](/assets/images/imagesdials.jpg)Reflecting on my activities in the last few months (especially around [Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling) and how [we](http://www.day.com) use it), I notice that _Developer Usability_ is often my concern.

How do we make our software more understandable, transparent, efficient and generally usable by developers? Good designs should be self-explaining, but in a complex system that's easier said than done.

There are many small things that influence this, as well as architectural decisions where one might trade off other criteria for developer usability.

I find it captivating to try and improve things so that people understand them better - I'll try to find out more about what makes the difference here, but for now I've made a few suggestions related to [documenting Sling](http://markmail.org/message/jlyjbu6o63pobtuy), which would hopefully apply to other projects as well.

(_Update: see the [next post](http://grep.codeconsult.ch/2008/02/19/bertrands-tentative-rules-for-maintainable-documentation/) for a more general view on those suggestions_).

I'm starting to think that documentation is like code comments: if you need lots of it, that's a bad sign.

Feedback is welcome.
