[![jazoon.jpg](/assets/images/jazoon.jpg)](http://jazoon.com)I'll be talking as a co-speaker with David Nuescheler at [Jazoon](http://jazoon.com/) next thursday, on [the revenge of the weblog in 15 minutes](http://jazoon.com/jazoon08/en/conference/presentationdetails.html?type=sid&detail=3140). The talk description still mentions _microjax_, but that's dead, it's the _Sling client library_ now. No conceptual changes though, that's mostly a renaming.

I'm working on the [Sling JST templates](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-466) this week, as the code that this template engine generated was way too ugly to be shown in public. That's getting better.
