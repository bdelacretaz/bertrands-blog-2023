I'm very happy that the jury recognized our important contributions to open source, even though some people would give us bad marks due to us selling our products.

See the [ossaward.ch](http://www.ossaward.ch/) site for the other awards - the choices in the Advocacy and Youth categories are particularly good in my opinon, rewarding people who use open source for humanitarian purposes, and youngsters who deserve to be encouraged.

Too bad iPhone pictures do not have a _shot with my iPhone_ watermark, that looks so good in emails ;-)
