[![ossaward2008.png](/assets/images/ossaward2008.png)](http://www.ossaward.ch/)The nominations are open on the [www.ossaward.ch](http://www.ossaward.ch/awards/) site, in the following categories: swissness (a project), business (a company), pioneer (a person or institution), advocacy (a person) and youth (a young person).

With my grumpy-french-speaking-minority hat on, I cannot help notice that that site is only available in german...but if I tell them I'm sure they'll suggest that I volunteer for translating ;-)
