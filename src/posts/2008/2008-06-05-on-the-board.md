The members meeting of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/foundation) is over, and I've had the pleasant surprise of being elected as a member of the [board](http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/).

Thanks very much to [Henning](http://henning.schmiedehausen.org/) for nominating me, and to everybody who put an **f** in their votes.

I'm replacing [Henri Yandell](http://blog.generationjava.com/) who decided not to run again this year, for very good [family reasons](http://blog.generationjava.com/roller/bayard/entry/levis-birth) as I understand. Thanks Henri for your work!

Apart from him the board is unchanged. That will probably make the transition easier than last year, when several directors were replaced at once. It feels good to be the newbie when you're 46 years old ;-)

Am I looking forward to it? Am I crazy? I guess yes and yes...

_Update: this was the first of many terms of the ASF's Board of Directors, see the [timeline](https://www.apache.org/history/directors.html) on the ASF's website._
