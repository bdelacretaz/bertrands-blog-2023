As a fan of well delivered presentations (who cannot afford [forklifts](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/) when speaking unfortunately) I find the [girl effect](http://www.girleffect.org)'s use of [kinetic typography](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/kt/) incredibly efficient. Full-screen viewing recommended.

Delivering a 50-minutes presentation like this would require paramedics on site I guess, but it looks so efficient for short and powerful messages...maybe I should try that in a future talk ;-)
