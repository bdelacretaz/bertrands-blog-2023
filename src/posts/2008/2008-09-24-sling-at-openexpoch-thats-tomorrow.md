We're talking about [Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling) at [openexpo.ch](http://openexpo.org/en) tomorrow, together with Michael Marth, Day's technology evangelist.

A number of Apache folk are talking there today and tomorrow, see the [program](http://openexpo.org/en) - and meet us at tonight's 6PM social event if you're around!

Here are our slides, but it's _much_ better live on stage, so be there anyway!

_Update: the demo code is available at [SLING-673](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-673)_.
