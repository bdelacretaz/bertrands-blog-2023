[![sling-logo-110x63.png](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/sling-logo-110x63.png)](http://incubator.apache.org/sling)We finally got around to documenting the [Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling) Launchpad (previously known as [Âµsling 2.0](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-149)) - so grab that while it's hot: [Discover Sling in 15 minutes](http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/discover-sling-in-15-minutes.html) will tell you everything you didn't dare to ask. Well, some of it, at least.

I'm very happy with how Sling has evolved since the beginning of the [microsling-driven partial rewrite](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-47): concepts have been clarified, the code structure is much easier to understand, we have tons of automated tests, and we're (slowly but surely) reaching a stable state that will allow people to have a closer look and hopefully start contributing more.

And it also looks like we're done renaming things every week ;-)

By the way, thanks to [GHOP](http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/) student [Paul Walker](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-asf/issues/detail?id=2), Sling got a new and improved logo - big thanks!
