[![logo_krugle_2007.png](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/logo_krugle_2007.png)](http://www.krugle.org)I'm sitting in Ken Krugler's [talk](http://us.apachecon.com/us2007/program/talk/1943) about [krugle.org](http://www.krugle.org), and I realize I should have looked at that earlier. The combination of projects searches, page searches and code searches is very powerful.
