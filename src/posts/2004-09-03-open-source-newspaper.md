...not quite, but the website of the (really good looking) [Scribus](http://www.scribus.org.uk/) Open Source Desktop Publishing tool reports that the [Twin Tier Times](http://www.twintiertimes.com/) newspaper uses _a production workflow centered on Scribus and other Open Source applications_.

Might become an official quality label some day: _Powered by Open Source_...
