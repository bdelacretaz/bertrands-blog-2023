According to [this](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2134514,00.html), custom-made HP laptops and desktops are sold in Thailand for 19'500 and 10'900 Baht (about 400 and 225 euro) respectively.

And guess what, they're running an OS which name starts with _Li_ and ends with _nux_ (the first reader to find out which one gets my your-mind-is-faster-than-light virtual award).

I made up the Volksputer name but I think it would be appropriate, considering that the project was initiated by Thailand's government, as a way of increasing computer ownership.

It's nice to see that some governments are _getting it_!
