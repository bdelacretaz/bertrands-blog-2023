[Whitespace](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php) looks like a promising new language, very well suited to literate programming.  
It looks so interesting that I even [suggested](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=104918725900003&r=1&w=2) using it for a partial or complete rewrite of [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org).  
We'll see what the community thinks, but in my opinion this is really A Project For Today...
