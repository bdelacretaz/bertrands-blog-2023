SCO finally [discloses](http://lwn.net/Articles/64052/) the super-secret rocket science Linux code that they think has been copied from their intellectual property.

Hmm..._(loud coughing in the background)_, err.._(clears his throat)_, pardon me _(gets this "ostrich back from Mars" look)_, you mean, C header files, really?

Linus seems to be strong enough to refrain from laughing in public and [concludes](http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0312.2/1241.html):

> ...we can totally \_demolish\_ the SCO claim that these 65 files were somehow "copied".

Good news.
