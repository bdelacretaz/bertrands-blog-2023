Very interesting discussions this morning (it's [FirstFriday](http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=FirstFriday)) on the #cocoon IRC channel, about the removal of @author tags in Cocoon's source files.

I have just posted a [summary](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=108089900026744&w=2) of our discussions so that everyone can comment before making any changes.

Hopefully our suggestions will allow due credit to be given, while avoiding the problems associated with @author tags. The idea is that release notes (for small things) and a _credits.txt_ file for the big picture will actually give better credit that the often out-of-sync @author tags.
