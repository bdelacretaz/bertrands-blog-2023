Such tools demonstrate in a nice way how open code has to be good to survive - now everyone can find out even more easily about your [suboptimal](http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=%22totally+broken%22&sbtn=Search), [politically](http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=damn+steve+jobs&sbtn=Search) [incorrect](http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=windows.*braindead&sbtn=Search) or [insecure](http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=%22security+risk%22&sbtn=Search) code.
