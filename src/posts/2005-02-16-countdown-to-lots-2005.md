Don't worry, I'll stop bothering you with these LOTS of posts in a few days. Or maybe not.

[LOTS 2005](http://www.lots.ch/2005) is starting tomorrow morning with some exciting [workshops](http://lots.ch/2005/WorkshopDay.html). On Friday it's the professional day with [several](http://www.lots.ch/2005/Referate.html?id=001) [talks](http://www.lots.ch/2005/Referate.html?id=043) that might be of [interest](http://www.lots.ch/2005/Referate.html?id=061) for [Cocoonistas](http://www.lots.ch/2005/Referate.html?id=045).

On Saturday, we have much cool [community stuff](http://lots.ch/2005/CommunityDay.html) including an open jam session in the evening, hosted by my good friend [Duane Kemp](http://kemppro.com) and a small band. I'll be on the drums, fun times ahead!
