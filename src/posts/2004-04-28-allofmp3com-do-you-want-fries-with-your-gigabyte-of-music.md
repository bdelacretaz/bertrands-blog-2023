[allofmp3.com](http://www.allofmp3.com) sells music by the gigabyte, at much lower prices than established web offerings (how about $66 for 4.7GB of MP3 music?).

According to the [Sydney Morning Herald](http://smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/26/1082831475556.html), they say that the corresponding rights are legally cleared - based on Russian law that is.

It will be interesting to see how the music biz world reacts once such offshore companies start eating a relevant part of their pie.
