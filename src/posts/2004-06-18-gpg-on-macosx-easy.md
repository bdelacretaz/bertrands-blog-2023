Preparing for the big trip I have finally created a [PGP key](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?search=bdelacretaz&op=index) for myself, which should help expand the ASF's web of trust [overseas](http://indexgeo.com.au/apache/).

Installing gpg on macosx was very easy using [macgpg](http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/) and the instructions at [fiatlux](http://fiatlux.zeitform.info/en/instructions/pgp_macosx.html).

So, just in case:

pub  1024D/015AFC8A 2004-06-18 Bertrand Delacretaz <bdelacretaz@apache.org>
Key fingerprint = 9E2F 96C6 40A0 731D 93BF  548E 37F6 8FF5 015A FC8A
uid Bertrand Delacretaz <bdelacretaz@codeconsult.ch>

_Update: David Crossley points me to [Henk Penning's](http://www.apache.org/~henkp/) page, which includes nice graphical renditions of the ASF's [web of trust](http://www.apache.org/~henkp/trust/apache.html)._

[Erik Abele](http://apache.org/~erikabele/wot/wot.html) also has an agora-based rendition of the same data.

_Update #2: I forgot to mention that I have uploaded my key to [pgp.mit.edu](http://pgp.mit.edu) as well, search for [bdelacretaz](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x015AFC8A)._
