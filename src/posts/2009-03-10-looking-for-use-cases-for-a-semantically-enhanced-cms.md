[![iks-logo.jpg](/assets/images/iks-logo.jpg)](http://www.iks-project.eu/)[Day](http://www.day.com) is participating as an industrial partner in the [Interactive Knowledge](http://www.iks-project.eu/) project, which aims to _provide an open source technology platform for semantically enhanced content management systems_.

We are starting to collect use cases for a semantically enhanced CMS - although I'm not 100% sure what _semantically enhanced_ means (and I assume that means different things to different people), I have started with use cases like the following:

> When I drop an image of a house in my content, the system allows me to see images of similar houses, and pages that talk about houses.

> When I start writing a new piece of content, the system optionally shows me similar content that's already in the repository, even if written in other languages.

> The system allows me to formulate queries like "recent pages that talk about houses to rent in the french part of Switzerland".

If you have additional ideas for such use cases, or examples of systems that provide such features, I'm all ears!
