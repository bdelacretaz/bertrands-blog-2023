Thanks to [Stefano](http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/) (with the help of faithful _[merlino](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=106622290509062&w=2)_), videos are available from the [Apache mirrors](http://www.apache.org/mirrors/). To download, select the closest mirror and then navigate to cocoon/events/gt2003/.

Presentation handouts are also available there. My presentation about [project](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000105.html) [tools](http://www.orixo.com/events/gt2003/sessions.html#bertrand) is found under _16-lightweight-tools-..._.

Of particular note is David Casal's [pipelined fugues](http://www.orixo.com/events/gt2003/sessions.html#david) piano presentation (_14-pipelined-fuges.avi_). This is _not_ your average slides-and-tech-talk presentation!
