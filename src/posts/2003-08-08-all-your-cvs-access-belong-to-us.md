Looks like the JBoss people [do](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=106012872900004&r=1&w=2) not [like](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=106023503700003&r=1&w=2) what's happening in the J2EE server world these days (via [Steven](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/archives/001077.html)).

Also, the banned committers seem to have been deleted from the JBoss credits pages. Big Brother is alive, for sure!

Weird. Every community has its problems, but decisions without discussions usually lead to wars. Time will tell.
