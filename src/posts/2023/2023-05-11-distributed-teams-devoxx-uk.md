Here are the slides of my "Distributed teams that _actually_ work" talk at Devoxx UK today.

I'll post the video recording link here once it's available.

The trick of adding my expected timings at the bottom of section title slides was useful,
timing is always a challenge when doing a talk for the first time. It worked.

I think the talk went well, as a compliation of thoughts and recommendations based on 
some of [my other talks](https://pinboard.in/u:bdelacretaz/t:pressbook/).
Lots of great questions from the audience, thank you!

Many thanks also to the organizers, great event, great venue, great organization, all positive!
