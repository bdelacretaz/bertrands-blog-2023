Here are the slides and recording of my "Distributed teams that _actually_ work" talk at Devoxx UK today.

<!-- excerpt -->

The trick of adding my expected timings at the bottom of section title slides was useful,
timing is always a challenge when doing a talk for the first time. It worked.

I think the talk went well, as a compilation of thoughts and recommendations based on 
some of [my other talks](https://pinboard.in/u:bdelacretaz/t:pressbook/).
Lots of great questions from the audience, thank you!

Many thanks also to the organizers, great event, great venue, great organization, all positive!
