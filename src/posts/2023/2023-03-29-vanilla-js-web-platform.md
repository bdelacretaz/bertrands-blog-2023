Speaking (in French) at the Very Tech Trip conference in Paris in February was nice!

Although the conference is very clearly vendor-driven, being organized by OVHCloud, a major European cloud provider, the vibe was very nice with lots of great technical content. Attendance was free, including food and beverages, which is a nice touch.

My talk was entitled "_VanillaJS et la Web Platform, le couple de l'année?_" which more or less translates to this post's title. Although the talk took place in one of the smaller rooms, it was full and I got a nice audience of developers asking great questions.

I'm hoping to do more talks around the Web Platform, as I'm spending a good amount of my time explaining and promoting it nowadays.

This particular topic is not very popular right now, as many developers still believe they cannot create a website without a client-side JavaScript framework, but things are changing. I'm hopeful.

The slides can be found below, and there's more on the
[Very Tech Trip](https://verytechtrip.com/) website.
