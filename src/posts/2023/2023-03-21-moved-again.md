Moving this blog to a platform where I have more 
(as in _complete_) control has been on my mind for a while.

<!-- excerpt -->

With Spring arriving I took the plunge and moved this blog
to a new setup based on the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site
generator, using Matt DeCamp's [eleventonia](https://github.com/mattdecamp/eleventonia)
starter project for the theme.

I've been able to keep most of my URLs stable over the years, but you'll probably find some dead links in older posts, as websites come and go. 

I _did_ dig out some missing images from a very old
[Movable Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type)
archive of the first version of this blog, the content of which has been
kept (mostly) intact over the years!

I haven't "ported" the comments however, as nowadays commenting
happens elsewhere and I didn't feel the need to install a specific
commenting service.

The magic of the _real_
Web is being able to move content over three platforms, losing
almost nothing and with very reasonable effort. Run away from
people who tell you otherwise!

I'm _so_ happy to see the Open
Web becoming more important again, with all the activity around
the Fediverse nowadays, personal blogs being important again and
RSS feeds being back!

The content goes back to 2002, it looks like I missed the opportunity
to celebrate my twenty years of blogging last year!
