Wrote my proposal for a Cocoon BEans And Forms Framework, that should make it much easier to write webapps with Cocoon.  
As evidenced by Torsten's [presentation](http://outerthought.net/gettogether/12%20-%20presentation%20-%20torsten.pdf) at the GetTogether, the current stuff is lacking and there is no single "best practice" for building webapps with Cocoon today.  
Hopefully this will help - after [posting](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xml-cocoon-dev&m=103786946103965&w=2) it I'm anxiously awaiting reactions...
