Google recently announced their [+1 button](http://www.google.com/+1/button/), which will without a doubt make the Internet a better place. What's not to like +1?

As everybody knows the _+1_ concept has been [invented](http://laughingmeme.org/2011/03/30/1-for-knowing-your-history/) at the [Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org) (ASF) - and it seems like there's event an ASF patent pending on it. (_Update: see also [here](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/199503.mbox/%3C9503152021.AA27714@ooo.lanl.gov%3E), via [@jaaronfarr](http://www.cubiclemuses.com/aaron)_). Our [voting process](http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html) makes extensive use of this simple and very effective concept.

If you do your math the bandwidth (and thus power, greenhouse gas, etc.) saved by using +1 instead of _I agree_ in all our emails _does_ make a difference for the planet - it's not just a fun gimmick.

In recognition of this invention, usually well informed sources tell us, Google is going to donate _3.141592654 cents_ (yeah that's Pi - they're Google, you know) to the ASF every time someone uses their +1 button, starting today!

That's excellent news for the ASF - as with any volunteer organizations, more funds mean more action, more power and more fun! I haven't yet been able to estimate how much money those N\*Pi +1 clicks represent in a year, but that's certainly in the _pile of money_ range.

A small downside is that we'll need to use _+1(tm)_, with the trademark sign, from now on. That's a small price to pay for what looks like a rosy financial future for the ASF.

Very impressive move. thanks Google! The Open Source world should mark today's very special date with a white stone, as we say in French.

+1(tm)!
