I was at [OpenWorldForum](http://openworldforum.org) in Paris a few weeks ago, together with fellow [Apache](http://apache.org) members Sander Striker and Emmanuel LÃ©charny.

My first impressions (apart from the fact that Paris is always nice - I knew that already) were that the French tend to wear suits and say "vous" (polite form of "you") instead of "tu" (the familiar form) which I would tend to use in geeky circles. Cultural differences...

But more seriously, how well does the french-speaking world know the Apache Software Foundation? Not well, it seems to me. In most of our discussions people could associate the ASF with the [Apache HTTP Server](http://httpd.apache.org) project, but not much more. 2'000 committers? 300 members? Really?

[![bertrand-tivipro.jpg](/assets/images/bertrand-tivipro.jpg)](http://www.tivipro.tv/chaine_salons.php?id=1804473&id_salon=374&pageIndex=1)To help improve this, I hope that the ASF can take a more active role in the conference next year, I'll bring this up next week at [ApacheCon](http://us.apachecon.com/c/acus2009/) with our conference people.

In the meantime french-speaking folks are welcome to learn a bit more about it thanks to TiViPRO's interviews of [Emmanuel](http://www.tivipro.tv/chaine_salons.php?id=1804472&id_salon=374&pageIndex=3) and [myself](http://www.tivipro.tv/chaine_salons.php?id=1804473&id_salon=374&pageIndex=1), shot during the conference.
