![notmuch.jpg](/assets/images/notmuch.jpg)I have just finished my slides for [next week at ApacheCon](http://us.apachecon.com/c/acus2009/sessions/293). Though the topic of how to "survive" in our open source communities has been on my mind for a while, this is a totally new presentation, which is both great (in the blank slate sense) and a lot of work.

![cocoon-step.jpg](/assets/images/cocoon-step.jpg)Having recently read [Presentation Zen](http://www.presentationzen.com/) (_very_ recommended if you do presentations and/or like beautiful books), I started adding full-screen pictures to the first few slides, and couldn't stop! The presentation will then consist of me ad-libbing (or more precisely trying to _tell stories_) on a series of nice pictures grabbed from [morguefile.com](http://morguefile.com) (don't worry about [that name](http://morguefile.com/docs/What_is_a_morguefile)).

![allabout.jpg](/assets/images/allabout.jpg)I'll post the slides here later, for now they are super secret, so you'll just get the teasers...images courtesy of morguefile.com (_update: slides added now_).

Hope to see you next week! In any case I have collected a number of useful links in my [delicious bookmarks](http://delicious.com/bdelacretaz/losc), I'll point people to them in the presentation.
