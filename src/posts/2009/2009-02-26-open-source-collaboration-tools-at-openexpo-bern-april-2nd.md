The [program](http://www.openexpo.ch/openexpo-2009-bern/konferenzprogramm/) for OpenExpo 2009 Bern is just out, I'll be giving my [Open Source Collaboration Tools are Good For You!](http://www.openexpo.ch/openexpo-2009-bern/konferenzprogramm/technology-track/#r04) talk on April 2nd.

I've been giving this talk a few times in various places already, and it often leads to interesting conversations, we'll see if that works in Switzerland as well! I must not forget to indicate that I can understand questions in German, as many people are more likely to ask questions in their native language.
