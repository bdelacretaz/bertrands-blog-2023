I have relooked and slightly expanded this presentation for [tomorrow at OpenExpo in Bern](http://www.openexpo.ch/openexpo-2009-bern/konferenzprogramm/technology-track/#r04) - the main addition is a discussion of the _fear of making mistakes in public_.

Talking to attendees last week at ApacheCon shows that people often struggle to introduce these tools and the open way of working in their companies. It seems like that fear can be an important blocking factor, and people are rarely explicitely aware of it.
