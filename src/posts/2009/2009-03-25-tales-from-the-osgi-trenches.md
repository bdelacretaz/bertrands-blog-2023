My [Tales from the OSGi trenches](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/c/aceu2009/sessions/189) presentation today at [ApacheCon](http://eu.apachecon.com) went well, timing was surprisingly good given that I gave this talk for the first time.

People can certainly relate to the issues that we've been facing with OSGi, and the realization is that the large majority of them can be linked to lack of developer education and lack of documentation and examples.

Things will get better, but my conclusions page already has a lot more smileys than monsters!
