Although I had marked the date in my calendar, a great [ApacheCon](http://www.apachecon.eu/) kept me busy and I missed Tuesday's date for announcing that it's been ten years now since I started blogging.

Not that you'd care...though it's fun to see that my interests and professional activities haven't changed that much in ten years. Less blogging of course, as over time this blog has morphed into an outlet for more permanent/longer content, which is less frequent of course.

The first few posts at [http://grep.codeconsult.ch/2002/11/](http://grep.codeconsult.ch/2002/11/) are not earth-shattering - that was a start though.

See you on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bdelacretaz) for now, as that's where my noise has mostly moved, and we'll see if this blog is still around in ten years!
