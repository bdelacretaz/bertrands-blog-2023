It was a pleasure yesterday to see about half of the (smaller than I expected) OSCOM audience turn up for my [talk](http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/supersonic). Looks like the promise of a _path through the jungle_ of Cocoon rings some bells..

After talking I was wondering if I had scared people too much with statements like "if you're scared of a command line you're in the wrong room" ;-)

But feedback has been positive. This image, in particular, was well received: _Apache Cocoon is like the toolbox of a very rich man: lots of tools, lots of options, lots of power...but one can get lost_. Giving an overview of a real-life application (I use my current [pet project](http://www.nouvo.ch) as an example) helps people find their way a lot.

If you missed the talk...see you at the [GetTogether](http://orixo.com/events/gt2004/) for release 1.1 of the same presentation!

I was looking forward to [Ugo's](http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/spring) talk about Spring and I wasn't disappointed: combining Spring (for business logic) with the Cocoon infrastructure looks like a very nice way of building applications, and Ugo explained very clearly how to do it. Got to test this one as well...
