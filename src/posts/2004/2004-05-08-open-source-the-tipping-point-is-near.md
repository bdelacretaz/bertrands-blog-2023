As [this article](http://www.vnunet.com/Analysis/1155002) says, the tipping point for Open Source is near.

Except for some niche markets, software companies doing business in the Same Old Way must be prepared to be _dinosaured_ by more serious Open Source offerings, in software, infrastructure and services.

This year I got two important new contracts _due to my involvement with Open Source_, which is new. Although I've been working with Open Source tools extensively since 1997, until now customers came to me for other reasons and accepted to use Open Source tools later in the process.

So it seems like 2004 will be the year where Open Source becomes mainstream. Good news!
