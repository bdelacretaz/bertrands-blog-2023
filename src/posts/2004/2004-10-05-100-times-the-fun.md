In the day-to-day work life I'm often the only Cocoon committer in the room but it looks like next week's [GetTogether](http://orixo.com/events/gt2004/) is going to be more than 100 times the fun!

The counter is at 105 participants and 16 countries this morning, and I think I know who's going to get the guy-who's-coming-from-the-most-far-away-place award - more on this in a few days.

Join the fun! The [program](http://orixo.com/events/gt2004/program.html) looks yummy, and it only mentions the daytime part - last year's evening social events and friendship were really good (you like spare ribs do you?).
