As I sometimes give book references here, I'm going to use try the Amazon _associates_ system and put links to amazon.com from the book covers. You can see an example in the [previous post](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000245.html).

It's as much an experiment as anything: you might find it useful to see more details about the book, and if you buy it directly from the linked page I get a small commission.

I don't expect much, but at least the book covers will put some color into these pages. Well, at least they should but the first book cover is grey ;-)

If you don't like it, just don't click on the book covers!
