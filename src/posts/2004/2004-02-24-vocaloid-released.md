 ![cover](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/0140282025.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg) A while ago I wrote about the [Vocaloid](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000183.html) technology from Yamaha.

Software packages have now been [released](http://www.zero-g.co.uk/) by Zero-G.

A male and a female software package actually, this is a new thing, I though software was (like snails) hermaphrodite!

The new [demos](http://www.zero-g.co.uk/index.cfm?articleid=802) sound impressive. I wouldn't use it as a lead singer voice but the combinations of real singers and vocaloid backings are amazing. I'm sure we'll hear some out-of-this-world voices from creative artists as well ;-)

At about 300 euro, this definitely brings us closer to _the age of spiritual machines_. Like the book, this is at the same time good, bad and scary...
