I started updating my blogroll from my NetNewsWire subscriptions file, but it's more work than I thought: some feeds are not meant to be shown here, being either irrelevant or private. Manually filtering them is no fun and error-prone.

In the end I decided to remove the blogroll, instead of feeling bad because it's not updated or feeling bad about being too lazy to update it.

Links to the (more than 120) feeds that I'm subscribed to will surface here regularly anyway, so the "web of weblogs" will still be present.

Note to self: remember that as soon as things need manual updating, _entropy kicks in_...
