I don't know [Erik Hatcher](http://weblogs.java.net/pub/au/15) personally but let me give him a big +1 for his [words](http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/1239) about software development.

_The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail_ (his citation from Tao Ching).

Right on! Let's be careful to keep our Open-Source projects (and our teams) soft and supple.
