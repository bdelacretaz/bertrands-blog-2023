This is _not_ about a rock'n roll band...listening to the [live recordings](http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/ma-6/sounds/) of John Glenn's Friendship 7 mission aboard the Mercury spaceship is just fascinating! Although everybody sounds very professional, you can feel a lot of tension at times when Glenn unexpectedly goes silent for a few seconds.

This was 1962. Their onboard computers probably had less computing power than today's wristwatches!
