The [Wikalong](http://wikalong.phunnel.org/) firefox sidebar uses a wiki as its backend, to store shared annotations about web pages that people visit (see the [screenshot](http://wikalong.phunnel.org/wiki/index.cgi?WikalongScreenshot1)).

Cool idea! Globally shared annotations would probably quickly become impractical, but shared with a reasonably sized group this could be very useful.
