[Groklaw](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040130235310123) explains in great detail why SCO _seem to be leaning on a rickety bamboo reed_. If insiders are just worried about selling their stock at the right times, they won't care much, but it's still good to hear a well-documented argument.

Ciao SCO, we won't miss you!

[Vadim](http://blog.reverycodes.com/archives/000012.html) also has some words about it, in a different tone ;-)
