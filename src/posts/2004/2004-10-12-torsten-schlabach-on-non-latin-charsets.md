[Torsten Schlabach](http://orixo.com/events/gt2004/bios.html#torsten), who's [active](http://www.paiwastoon.com/) in Afghanistan (and indicates that yes they have electricity there, even Internet caf√©s) is on the GT stage to talk about Cocoon and non-latin character sets.

Lots of interesting points on how to handle this properly, including

- Being careful about HTTP headers matching charset definitions in html elements.
- Using UTF-8 encoding as the only one that is found everywhere.
- [Alan Wood's](http://alanwood.net/unicode) Unicode resources.
