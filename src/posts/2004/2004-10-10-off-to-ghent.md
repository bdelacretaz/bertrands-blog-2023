[Like](http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001993.html) [many](http://www.beblogging.com/blog/2004/10/10/093703) [others](http://vafer.org/blog/tcurdt/archives/000148.html) I'm leaving for [Ghent](http://orixo.com/events/gt2004/) in a short while. Thanks to the efficient [SNCB](http://www.b-rail.be) I was even able to buy my train tickets in advance, very convenient.

I'm really looking forward to this edition! In my opinion the strong point this year will be the many success stories that we'll hear about Cocoon.

_the trip was awful, between a cancelled flight and late trains I arrived in Ghent at 1AM instead of 10:30 PM..._
