You know that winword [crashes](http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/archives/000210.html) just when you would need it to work and too often eats your documents for breakfast.

[![cover](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/0672316498.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672316498/bertrandswebl-20)But did you realize that it leaks as well? SCO [found out the hard way](http://news.com.com/2100-7344_3-5170073.html) when confidential information was found in the revisions data of a word document that was sent around (in SCO's case this might all be orchestrated towards stock-spinning FUD, but you get the idea).

The inmates are _really_ running the asylum. Can't we go back and give everybody a simple editor which uses some kind of structured text or HTML as its native format?
