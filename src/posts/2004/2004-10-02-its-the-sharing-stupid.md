According to Kevin Bedell's [Tip of the Iceberg](http://www.linuxworld.com/story/46473_p.htm) article, Microsoft is worried about companies adopting the _noncommercial software model_ doing business _..without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software_.

Of course we're not bearing the full cost - we're _sharing_ it. And it does make a lot of sense, as much as mathematicians, as Kevin indicates, share their basic algorithms and techniques.

If you're following [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org) you might have noticed that the dev list has become much quieter than it was since a few months. My little finger tells me that it's because most of us are busy _building great applications_ with it. For me this is very good news: although the pace of framework development slows down a bit, this means that it is _working_. We'll have a some nice success stories at the [GT](http://orixo.com/events/gt2004/), stay tuned!

Have a look also at what's boiling in the [ASF incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/index.html). Although some stuff is very new, you can easily imagine what could come out of this in a few months or a year: even greater shared toolboxes.

I'm talking about Cocoon and the [ASF](http://apache.org) because it's the "world" that I know best, but this sharing movement is of course not limited to this - there's much more out there.

It's the _sharing_, stupid!
