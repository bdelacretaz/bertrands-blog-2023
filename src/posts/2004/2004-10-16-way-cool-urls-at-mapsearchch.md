So even if [map.search.ch](http://map.search.ch) maps are not really [up to date](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000382.html), I had missed their way cool URLs. Thanks [Urs](http://circle.ch/blog/p1534.html).

For example: you want know where "rue du simplon 3" in Renens is? Here you go: [http://map.search.ch/renens/simplon-3](http://map.search.ch/renens/simplon-3). If you're around during office hours, call me for a drink!
