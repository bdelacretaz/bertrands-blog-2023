Carlos E.Perez has a [new list](http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/open_source_portal_servers_in_java), about portal servers this time.

To Cocoonistas: yes I did check, we're in the list, _rumored to eventually support JSR-168_. Someone better informed than me might want to comment on the actual JSR-168 status there.
