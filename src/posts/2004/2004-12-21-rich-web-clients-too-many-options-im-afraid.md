[![](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/0060005688.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060005688/bertrandswebl-20)I haven't posted about the _paradox of choice_ after reading it earlier this year, but I really enjoyed it: Barry Schwartz explains how having too many options makes our 21st century lives much more stressful and our choices much harder. Very true - I think being able to make hard choices and not regret them later is a very important skill in today's world.

It's not _that_ bad for me in this case, but I'm looking at rich web client options for a new project, and the choice is not easy. Have a look at my short list:

- [OpenLaszlo's](http://openlaszlo.org) demos have the best looks and interactivity by far, and Flash is everywhere. On the other hand, it's very unfamiliar as a language. Very tempting but it would take some betting on where we're going to be in three years.

- [XUL](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/) has been around longer, it takes a while to understand what goes where but examples such as the [Mozilla Amazon Browser](http://www.faser.net/mab/remote.cfm) are very convincing. Problem is, people who don't have the [best browser around](http://www.mozilla.org/) would need to install it. Wouldn't harm them much though.

- [JGoodies](http://www.jgoodies.com) shows that it _is_ possible to write good-looking and usable java client applications, and delivering them via Java Web Start works well. I've been there already a few years ago with [verbalix](http://www.it-processing.ch/index.php?id=17&L=2) so this is another valid option, maybe the less risky of all in technical terms.

- [XmlHttpRequest](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000317.html) is making the news once again due to its adoption for the [Google suggest](http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en) beta (dissected [here](http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/2004/12/google-suggest-dissected.html)). The big advantage is that this works with most current browsers witout additional components. It's a bit of a new territory as well, but some server-side glue would certainly help.

Too often, software = hard choices, really.
