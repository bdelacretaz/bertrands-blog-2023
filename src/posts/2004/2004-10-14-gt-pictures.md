If you missed it, pictures can be found [here](http://www.pbase.com/stevenn/gt2004) and [here](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/cocoongt2004/).

As [Matthew](http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001999.html) says: getting more than 130 people from 17 countries to gather and talk _peacefully_ is no mean feat. Big thanks to everyone involved!

_Update: don't miss [Michael Melhem's](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/michaelm/archives/002154.html) beautiful view of Ghent_!

_Update #2: [Sylvain](http://www.anyware-tech.com/blogs/sylvain) has created a list of links to photos on the [Cocoon wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/GT2004Pictures)_
