Swisscom, our largest mobile operator, [announces](http://www.swisscom-mobile.ch/prv_asp/prv_home.asp?nid=1662&UserLanguage=E&Sitename=PRIVATE) flat-rate GPRS surfing for 5 CHF (about 3.50 euro) a month.

The catch is, this is surfing on _their portals_ only, but it's still a nice step in the right direction.
