This month's Software Development magazine publishes an [article about Cocoon](http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/s=9058/sdm0403f/sdm0403f.html) (registration required). It's a good overview in my opinion.

The author awards Cocoon four stars, meaning _this product is near the top of its class and probably belongs in your shop_. I have to agree ;-)
