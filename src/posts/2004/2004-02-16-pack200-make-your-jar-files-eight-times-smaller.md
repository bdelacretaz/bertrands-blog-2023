Sounds like one of those spam ads but this one seems to be true: the new [Pack200](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/deployment/deployment-guide/pack200.html) compression mechanism can apparently reduce the size of jar files by a factor of 8.

Sun's page explains that clever rearranging of a jar's contents makes it much more suitable to zip compression.

Via [Nicola Ken](http://jroller.com/page/nicolaken/20040216) who has more to say on JDK 1.5 goodies.
