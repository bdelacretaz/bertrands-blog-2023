It's not hard to predict a huge increase in the use of RSS feeds once Aunt Tillie finds out about the ease of use and benefits of a good RSS client.

Reuters' [RSS feeds](http://news.reuters.com/newsrss.jhtml) are another step in this direction. I bet that in a few years even [small villages](http://www.cugy-vd.ch/) like mine will use RSS feeds to keep their citizens informed.
