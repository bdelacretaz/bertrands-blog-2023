I might sound like in a Microsoft bashing mood these days, but frankly: they have been awarded patent [6,687,897](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=/netahtml/search-adv.htm&r=9&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=ptxt&S1=Microsoft.ASNM.&OS=AN/Microsoft&RS=AN/Microsoft) for _Systems, methods and data structures for encompassing scripts written in one or more scripting languages in a single file_.

Basically, the _innovative idea_ is that one can store several scripts in different languages in a single XML file. Wow, verrrrry clever!

It shouldn't be too hard to find prior art ;-)
