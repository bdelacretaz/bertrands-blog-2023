> How would you feel if you had to regularly expense $1200 so you could “tell a few teammates something”. Think that would go over well? (Jason Fried)

<!-- excerpt -->

Last Monday I presented on [Asynchronous Decision Making](https://www.slideshare.net/bdelacretaz/asynchronous-decision-making-foss-backstage-2017) at the (excellent) [FOSS Backstage](https://foss-backstage.de/) Micro Summit in Berlin and there were some questions about me saying that status meetings are a waste of time.

My opinion on status meetings hasn't changed in a long time and I'm very happy to see Jason Fried loudly confirm it in his _[status meetings are the scourge](https://m.signalvnoise.com/status-meetings-are-the-scourge-39f49267ca90)_ post.

If your team shape allows you to run status meetings, you should first reflect on their actual cost. And if you still want to run them after that I suggest:

a) Requiring people to briefly report their status in writing before the meeting, asynchronously

b) Requiring people to read other people’s status before the meeting, asynchronously

c) Choosing a maximum of 3 items to discuss in your meeting, based on those reports, and timebox those topics during the meeting

d) If you don't get enough items to deserve interrupting your whole team _right now_: cancel that meeting! Or maybe limit it to managers to avoid [interrupting the Makers](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

That's just the essentials, Jason Fried has more detailed suggestions in a similar spirit, make sure to read his post!

I like the 3P format for brief written status reports:

\- Progress: what concrete, measurable progress has been made since last report

\- Problems: what's blocking you from progressing

\- Perspectives: what are your plans for the next period

If this post (and Jason's) help you save tons of money by eliminating useless meetings, feel free to make a donation to a good cause ;-)
