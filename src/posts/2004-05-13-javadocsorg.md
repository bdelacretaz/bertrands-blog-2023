All of Sun's javadocs are now [available online](http://javadocs.org) from a central place, and can be easily searched using URLs like [http://javadocs.org/socket](http://javadocs.org/socket). Empty result sets are redirected to Google, how's that for a useful web service?

Via [Cedric Beust](http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000129.html) who's also got a useful firefox link trick. There's also a comment with a link to useful [Mozilla searchlets](http://www.petefreitag.com/searchlets/) on his page.
