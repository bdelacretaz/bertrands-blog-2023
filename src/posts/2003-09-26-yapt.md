Yet Another Presentation Tool - following our discussions on the evils of PowerPoint (and thinking about the time that one can loose when too many options are available), I wrote a very simple and lightweight presentation tool, included in Cocoon as a sample in the _slop_ block.

The idea is to generate a decent-looking presentation from a simple structured text file, which looks like:

presentation: About presentation tools
author: Bertrand Delacr√©taz
.
slide: This is the first slide
And this is the first paragraph.
.
slide: Second slide
img\_leftHalf: funny.jpg
We just added an image, which will be shown on the left half of this page.

Cool CSS tricks allow images to be scaled cleanly (within the limit of physics) by the browser.

Simple enough? Grab your instant presentation tool at [the Cocoon site](http://cocoon.apache.org)!
