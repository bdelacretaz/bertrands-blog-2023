Even with optimism deeply implanted in your genes it's hard not to be depressed these days.

So, according to the polls people have voted Bush because of his values. Aha.

Me, I thought values were worthless unless they translate to visible beneficial actions, words and wisdom towards the outside.

Like, I thought [this](http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&passage=matthew%2B5%3A37&version=NIV) would evidently be one of the top five priorities for a Christian:

> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.

But it looks like people who voted Mr.Bush for his values don't care too much about this - or they are not the same people (more and more of them) who believe the Iraq war to be based on a series of lies.

I'm very sorry for all my friends and fellow webloggers who were hoping of firing W. Despite the values thing, It looks like fear has won once again.
