Here are Brian's success indicators for Open Source projects, from his [Apache: When the Code Just isnâ€™t Enough](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/konferenzen/psecom,id,488,track,8,nodeid,,_language,uk.html#session-bts2) ApacheCon session.

A Successful Open Source project:

- Has a healthy community

- Makes decisions by consensus

- Can survive people being hit by a (rarely real, but often virtual) bus

- Can survive poisonous people

- Doesn't let perfect, be the enemy of good

- Has a mission statement

- Documents both software and processes

There's much more to his presentation, but this list is the best part for me.
