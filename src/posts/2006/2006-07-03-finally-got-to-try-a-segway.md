![segway-montreux-2006-07-02.jpg](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/segway-montreux-2006-07-02.jpg)Yesterday I was finally able to try a Segway, and this thing rocks! Riding it is very natural, and a lot of fun.

It's still quite expensive though (more than 4'000 euro), and apparently not really street legal here yet.

If you're around the [Montreux Jazz Festival](http://montreuxjazz.com/), it's worth trying it! Yesterday you could test them right below the Montreux Palace, but I didn't check if [they](http://www.facilitech.ch)'re going to be there the whole week.
