Congratulations to the [ASF](http://apache.org)'s [Brian Behlendorf](http://brian.behlendorf.com/) for being invited to [speak](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20060124005216&newsLang=en) at the [World Economic Forum](http://www.weforum.org/).

Another sign of Open Source (well, I should rather say "exceptional people in Open Source") getting the recognition that it deserves.

As Stefano says, _seems like his social network is about to undergo a phase transition_.
