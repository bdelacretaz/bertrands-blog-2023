Looks like Bluewin are having problems with their webmail, and as this blog is well indexed with an [old post](http://www.codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000185.html) about email problems with Bluewin...guess where people turn?

So, let me state it clearly: I don't have root access to Bluewin's mail servers, and as such cannot help that much...submitting requests for help on [that post](http://www.codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000185.html) will only make you look stupid.

Especially if you only leave your Bluewin address for the reply.
