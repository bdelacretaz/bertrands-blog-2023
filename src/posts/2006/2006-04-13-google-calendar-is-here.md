![Ajax!](http://codeconsult.ch/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/04//archives/images/ajax.jpg)The long-awaited [Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/) has landed.

Just played with it for 5 minutes and it's as boring as it should - this thing Just Works.

IMHO, the Rich Internet Client technology wars are over.
