[![flash-full-screen.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/flash-full-screen.jpg)](http://staging.mutoid.nl/fullscreen/index_cars.html)Just found out that the [Flash Player 9](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html) does [full-screen video](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flash_Player:9:Update:Full-Screen_Mode) (and full-screen Flash animations of course).

There are some convincing [demos](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flash_Player:9:Update:Full-Screen_Mode:Demos) at Adobe Labs.

Coupled with [lightweight streaming](http://del.icio.us/bdelacretaz/flash+streaming) of FLV video, this is Really Good News.
