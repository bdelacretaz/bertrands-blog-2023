[![bdelacretaz-apachecon-eu-2006  slide](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/bdelacretaz-apachecon-eu-2006-slide.jpg)](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/konferenzen/psecom,id,488,track,8,nodeid,,_language,uk.html#session-bts4)My _Open Source project tools for corporate projects_ [presentation](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/konferenzen/psecom,id,488,track,8,nodeid,,_language,uk.html#session-bts4) is ready.

It's a rework of the one I did at the [Cocoon GetTogether 2003](http://www.codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000593.html). Things haven't changed much since then, except that business types are finally starting to be interested in this: why is it that (apparently) chaotic Open Source projects succeed, while (apparently) well-structured corporate projects fail? You'll find out if you're there ;-)

My talk is part of the [business track](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/konferenzen/psecom,id,512,nodeid,512.html), which explains why it [isn't listed](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000665.html) in the "plain" sessions [list](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/konferenzen/divers/psecom,id,339,nodeid,487.html).

I've booked a room at the Albany House for the whole week, and it looks like [several Cocoonistas](http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/ApacheConEU2006) will stay there as well. Looking forward to it!
