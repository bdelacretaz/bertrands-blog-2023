As mentioned on [Wired News](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,69793-0.html?tw=wn_tophead_1) itself, that site now runs on [Apache Lenya](http://lenya.apache.org/) (which as you all know is based on [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org)) now (via [Gregor](http://greg.abstrakt.ch/archives/2006/01/lenya_getting_wired.html)). Congratulations to [Wyona](http://wyona.com/) for landing the gig!

And if you've been reading between the lines of some Cocoonista's blogs recently, it seems like another Cocoon-based CMS is going to make some noise soon.

I'm not talking about [nouvo.ch](http://www.nouvo.ch) where fun stuff is also happening (more on that later), but something which sounds much bigger according to the faint traces left here and there. How come Amsterdam is suddenly so attractive in winter?

Well, 2006 is just beginning but it sounds exciting already ;-)
