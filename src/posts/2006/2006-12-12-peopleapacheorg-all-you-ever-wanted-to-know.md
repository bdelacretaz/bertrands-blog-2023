[![committers-map.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/committers-map.jpg)](http://people.apache.org/map.html)Thanks to the great work of [David Reid](http://www.david-reid.com/cynic/?p=504), the [people.apache.org](http://people.apache.org) site now lists all kinds of information about [ASF](http://apache.org) committers.

All this is generated from RDF files using the [foaf](http://www.foaf-project.org/) vocabulary. If you're a committer, add your info in the committers/info directory, see the README there.
