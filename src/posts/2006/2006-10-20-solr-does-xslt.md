I have contributed a simple [XSLT response writer](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/XsltResponseWriter) to [Solr](http://incubator.apache.org/solr/).

It's not rocket science, but it adds useful output formats (custom XML or HTML, SVG or any other text-based format) to Solr's query results, in addition to the existing XML, JSON, Python and Ruby output formats.
