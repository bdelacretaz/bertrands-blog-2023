![SP_A0191.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/SP_A0191.jpg)I'm sitting in the [Amphimax](http://www.unil.ch/central/page3032_fr.html) at the University of Lausanne, for the keynotes of the [foss4g2006](http://www.foss4g2006.org/) conference, which is about _Free and Open Source Software for Geoinformatics_.

I have nothing to do with GIS, but as it's so close to my office, and I know some of the guys behind the conference, it's a great opportunity to get to know this community.

The conference program is packed, the organization looks good, the screens are huge as you can (barely) see on the picture, and the wifi is good.

I haven't found info on the IRC backchannel yet, let's see if ngrep finds it...

We're currently having the _quart d'heure vaudois_, a local tradition where everything has to start fifteen minutes late. Not uncommon for conferences, but here it's even better as it gives it a more local feel ;-)
