I really need a blog in French for more local stuff...

For now here it is: the workers of [Swissmetal](http://www.swissmetal.com/), who are on strike since about ten days (which is _very_ uncommon in Switzerland), have started a blog at [www.laboillat.blogspot.com](http://www.laboillat.blogspot.com/) (in French).

Another sign, as if we needed one, that 2006 will be The Year When Blogs Became Mom-and-Pop Things.
