I'm too busy preparing the soup to translate the recipe, but it's on my [french-speaking blog](http://codeconsult.ch/blog/2006/12/23/la-soupe-a-la-biere-a-roger). Learning some French will do you good anyway, and it's simple language!

Roger's beer soup is great when you have to cater for many people, easy to prepare and very good.
