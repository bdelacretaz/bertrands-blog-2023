Thanks Jeremias for the heads-up: the [ApacheCon](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/) sessions program silently appeared on the conference website. Click on the _Timetable_ icon to see it.

And my [optimistic math](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000656.html) was correct: my _Open Source tools and corporate projects_ session (WE2) has been accepted. Funny, I thought this would be the last of my three proposals to be accepted! So it's good to make diverse proposals, you never know how they'll fit in the whole thing.

The program looks great, I can already see places where I'll have to make hard choices between equally interesting sessions.
