The M$ download page (no I'm not linking to that;-) says _upgrade with confidence_. According to my colleagues who have tested it, this might indicate that IE7 faithfully reproduces most bugs of its predecessors, while adding a new set of fun and original ones. There's a [better way](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/).

Worse, it seems like windows update will push this new and improved pile of...software to masses of unsuspecting customers. Be ready for some of these _how come I suddently cannot read your site anymore?_ messages.
