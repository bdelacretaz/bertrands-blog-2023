[![hit-a-hint-extension.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/hit-a-hint-extension.jpg)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1341/)Pekka Sillanpaa's [Hit-a-Hint](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1341/) extension for Firefox allows you to activate links by holding the space bar and typing numbers that appear near links (the small gray numbers that you see on the screenshot).

Great! I declare it the winner of my (just created) most-ergonomic-extension-of-the-week award.
