![iceland-crossing.jpg](/assets/images/movable-type-blog-archives/iceland-crossing.jpg)Coming back from lonely but lovely Iceland to our crowded country is a bit hard...on the other hand we 're very lucky to have been able to spend some time there.

The [4WD camper](http://www.randburg.com/is/camper/campersinfo01.asp) was ideal for discovering the most bizarre places, even though the "roads" to [Landmannalaugar](http://www.landmannalaugar.info/) and [Laki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laki) were still closed. Those will be for next time maybe. Getting to the [Thorsmork](http://www.thorsmork.is/index_english.html) valley was easier, we just [followed the bus](http://www.thorsmork.is/pictures/album/pages/IMG_2591_JPG.htm), whose driver obviously knows his way through the creeks.

The many useless 4WDs cruising our cities look even more useless now ;-)
