![sylvain-on-ichat.jpg](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/images/sylvain-on-ichat.jpg)Yesterday we had our (now [annual](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000507.html)) videoconference where my students interview a pro. Thanks [Sylvain](http://bluxte.net/) for your wise words, they have been well received!

Sylvain's last advice to my students was to open a blog and leave a valuable trace on the Internet. So get these living resumes going!

We have at least one more exciting videoconference in the pipeline for this class, looking forward to it!
