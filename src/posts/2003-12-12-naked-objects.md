Very interesting [concept](http://www.nakedobjects.org/), for prototyping and maybe more.

This reminds me of an application framework that I created back in 1932 (or slightly later, it's this age thing again) with Clipper, where one only had to define a data dictionary to get a rough yet workable data management application.

The naked objects goes much further, and I like the idea of empowering users by exposing business objects to them.

_note: if you don't know what Clipper is, you might have been born too late ;-)_
