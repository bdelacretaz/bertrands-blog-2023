I'm working on lightweight CMS concepts for a (potential) new project these days, and have been looking at wysiwyg editors that work (meaning _work_) in a browser.

[htmlArea](http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/), currently added to the Cocoon Forms samples, is still in beta for mozilla but already looks very usable. I can't wait to try it on actual content (like that cool prototype from the _FlowLimitationCircumventer_ people ;-), as it seems to be in widespread use already.

An alternative would be to use a java-based thing like [hexidec Ekit](http://www.hexidec.com/ekit.php). The drag is that clients need the Java Plugin, but once it's installed the risk of running into browser incompatibilities should be lower, so it might be a good alternative to javascript-based solutions.
