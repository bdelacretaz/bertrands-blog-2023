I'm following [Tristan Nitot's](http://www.nitot.com/) very interesting presentation entitled [Gutenberg and the Guerilleros](http://lots.ch/2005/Referate.html?id=115) at...you know where don't you?

Although Tristan and Stefano (who gave a [brilliant keynote](http://lots.ch/2005/Referate.html?id=001) this morning) didn't know each other before yesterday evening, it's very interesting to hear a common theme in their talks: where Stefano says _what would the Web be if all software were closed and sold in boxes_ (I'm paraphrasing, but his keynote should be online in a few days), Tristan says _where would the world be if Gutenberg had been killed by people willing to keep copying of texts a closed market_. Answer to both is: _not much_.

Food for thought...
