Jim Jagielski probably forgot to turn on comments on his [post about not memorizing stuff](http://www.jimjag.com/imo/index.php?/archives/147-Personal-break-Boss.html), so here's my comment:

I don't make any effort to memorize any API parameters or class names either. My neurons are too precious to be wasted on such stuff, and online help and code assistants are my friends.

People (or students) are sometimes surprised when I have to look up some common API call - but my brain is not of the _store all kinds of constants_ kind.

Except for [useless numbers](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000745.html), of course.
