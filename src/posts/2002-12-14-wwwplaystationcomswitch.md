Don't look there, this address doesn't exist yet, but maybe it should..  
My eleven-year old son got fed up with the family games PC crashing and Daddy having to spend yet another evening fixing it, so we decided to switch to a better games platform (in case you're wondering, I got fed up too...).  
The consensus about Windows hiding a pile of crap inside seems to grow every day, and I'm happy that even our kids seem to get the message. Windows would definitely be a bad example for them to follow in their future activities and carreers - let's hope they will have higher standards of quality when their time comes!  
In fact slashdot just published a [story](http://slashdot.org/articles/02/12/15/032201.shtml?tid=127) about switching to game consoles, looks like we're not the only ones.
