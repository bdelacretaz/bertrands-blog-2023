[![mtc.jpg](http://bdelacretaz.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/mtc.jpg)](http://www.mtc.lu/Prochain-Event.html)I'll be speaking at the next [Meet the Communities](http://www.mtc.lu/Prochain-Event.html) event on June 12th, on [Working in and with the Apache Software Foundation](http://www.mtc.lu/Prochain-Event/presentations.html#bdelacretaz).

Looking forward to meeting new people including [Christophe Lombart](http://www.linkedin.com/in/christophelombart), original developer of the Graffito object-to-JCR mapping that's now part of Jackrabbit and used in Sling.

The one-hour flight from Geneva to Luxembourg costs more than New York...but small airports are always nice!
