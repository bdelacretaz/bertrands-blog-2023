As with many things, I wish I could do more for [jfor](http://www.jfor.org), so it feels good to at least be able to put out [V0.7.2rc1](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29441) as a release candidate.

My recent [post](http://codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000068.html) about the future of jfor prompted some encouraging comments, and as a result we have two new commiters: welcome Peter and Conal!
