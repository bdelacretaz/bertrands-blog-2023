<h2>Favorite posts</h2>

  <p>
    Here's a list of my favorite posts. Milestones, writings that I'm proud of, etc., going all
    the way back to the early 2000s, when I started my first tech blog.

  <p>
    I've been able to keep most of my URLs stable over the years, but you'll probably
    find some dead links in older posts, as websites come and go.
